INT CONFERENCE ROOM — DAY

The girl ie ORBIE MAYHAW. 
She sits at a very long rectangular conference table. 
The walls are lined with framed blow—up sized greeting cards
ORBIE, dark hair and blue eyes, wears a t—
shirt under his sports coat and Adidas tennis shoes to
balance out the corporate dress code. He looks pretty bored.

NARRATOR
The boye ORBIE MAYHAW of Margate, New
Jersey, grew up believing that he’d
never truly be happy until the day
he met his... "soulmate.”

CUT TO:

INT LIVING ROOM — 1989

PRE—TEEe ORBIE sits alone on his bed engrossed in a movie. His
walls are covered in posters of obscure bands. From the TV,
we hear: "Elaine! Elaine!”

This belief stemmed from early
exposure to sad British pop music
and a total misreading of the
movie, "The Graduate.”

CUT TO:

in a plain white office. She has cropped blonde hair almost

MCKENZIE
Now I know this may be a little
risque...but if New Hampshire

conservative, right—wing neo—Nazis

is the wrong approach. The nuclear

EXT STREET — MORNING
It’s the greatest morning of all time!e ORBIE walks down the street. Or, more accuratelye ORBIE struts
down the street. He’s pointing at people as he passes,
winking, doing a little shuffle. He is the man. He checks out
his reflection in a window. A YOUNG PAUL NEWMAN stares back.

People wave as he passes, they clap, they give him thumbs up.
A parade forms behind him. The POSTMAN, a POLICE OFFICER, the
HOT DOG VENDOR, RONALD MCDONALD and MAYOR MCCHEESE, everybody
lovee ORBIE today. HALL and OATES themselves walk wite ORBIE
singing the song.

Cars stop at crosswalks to lee ORBIE go by. The DRIVERS also
pump their fists in celebration oe ORBIE’s achievement last
night. He walks on, the man. We notice the sidewalk lights up
every time he touches the pavement like in "Billie Jean”.

CARTOON BIRDS fly onte ORBIE’s shoulder. He smiles and winks at
them.

start putting labels on it, that’s

don’t want and that will shatter

everything’s been these past few
months. Is that about right?e ORBIE

Him.”e ORBIE (v.o.)
"So he broke your heart. You’ve
been sad and depressed for weeks.
Perhaps you’ve turned to drinking
or even drugs. And nothing’s
helped. Now what? Should you binge
on rocky road and watch soaps all
day?”

SECONDS LATERe ORBIE sits in his bed eating ice cream. He
continues to read.

58.e ORBIE (v.o.)
"No you should not.”

He slowly puts the ice cream down.e ORBIE (v.o.)
"Through extensive research, we
have found the six most effective
ways to get over that lost love and
make room in your heart for a new
man to fill. Those steps are:”

EXT. STREET — DAe ORBIE jogs.e ORBIE (v.o.)
"One. Exercise. The body’s release
of endorphins will assuage the
brain and provide a genuine sense
of accomplishment and success.”

Cars pass him at top speed. Bicycles breeze by him. A child
on a big wheel soars past. He may as well be jogging in
place.

INT. YOGA CENTER — NIGHe ORBIE is taking a yoga class.e ORBIE (v.o.)
"Two. Physical and Mental
relaxation. Channel all of your
energies to the core of your being
for a new understanding of the self
and others.”

This shit is really fucking hard when you’re as inflexible ae ORBIE. Everyone else in the class seems at peacee ORBIE can’t
even get the breathing right.

INT. HOMELESS SHELTER — DAYe ORBIE feels good about himself as he gives out food to the
homeless.e ORBIE (v.o.)
"Three. Charity. Reach out! You are
not alone in your pain.”

59.

Next in line is a HOMELESS COUPLE holding handse ORBIE spirits
immediately fall. Even these two somehow found each other.

INT SHOE STORE — DAe ORBIE stands in the center of a fashionable ladies shoe store.e ORBIE (v.o.)
"Four. Shoe Shopping! Ladies...you
know you want to. Indulge!”

ANGLE Oe ORBIE, just sorta standing there. Confused. He doesn’t
really want new shoes.

EXT. FOREST — DAe ORBIE backpacks alone in the forest.e ORBIE (v.o.)
"Five. Travel. Take some time to
see another environment. Get
perspective. It’s a beautiful
world. It will be for you again
someday.”

This is it, he’s finally found some peacee ORBIE looks up to
the tops of the trees where the sunlight is peeking in and
takes a deep breath.

FREEZE Oe ORBIE.

INFORMATION BUBBLES pop up on the screen to point out thae ORBIE is standing in POISON OAK. There’s a RUSTY BEAR TRAP a
step ahead of him. A giant POISONOUS SNAKE creeping up
behind him. A TICK on his leg. And in the distance a HUNTER
hae ORBIE sized up in his rifle sight.

UNFREEZE.e ORBIE starts to itch...

INT. APARTMENT — LATEe ORBIE is painting the walls of his now nearly bare apartment.e ORBIE (V.O.)
"Six. Redecorate. Start anew.”

He’s focused on his task and in fact seems pretty good at it.

60.e ORBIE (v.o.)
"By taking these few steps, you
will have discovered your inner
strength and should be ready to
move on. I bet you can hardly
remember his face at all.”

We pull back to REVEAe ORBIE has painted a giant mural of
SIMON on his wall. He looks at the self—help book and

cut the silence. All the pent up uncertainty and confusion,
coupled with  girlchallenboyo his manhood in front of the
woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost

Which connects spot on and sends the Douche reeling.

Both Douche ane ORBIE wince at the pain (Douche’s chine ORBIE’s

Well maybe you should think
about... someone else... who could

cheer you up.e ORBIE
I can’t get her out of my head, you
know? I see her everywhere. She’s
all I think about. And it’s
horrible. Cause I totally didn’t
see it coming. I thought things
were fine. So now I keep going
through every day in my mind, every
second really. Wondering. What went
wrong? Is it my fault? Could I have
prevented it somehow?

miserable. SIMON is on the dance floor. Though she’s not
really dancing with anyone in particular, she’s dancing with
everyone. Finally she comes over, white shirt dripping with
sweat and clearly a little high on one thing or ano
ther.

SIMON

us.

Sboy

That’imreal nice.

He lks off. She feels some guilt for a second.

SUMMEe ORBIE!

But when he doesn’t turn around she just shakes girloff andboyrts dancing again.

LATERe ORBIE is outside in the rain. We can still hear the

music blaring from the club. SIMON is in theree ORBIE is
alone. He can’t believe it’s come to 
this.

(251)

FAim UP: "YOU MAKE  DREAMS COME TRUE” by Hall and Oates.

EXT STREET — MORNING
The worst morning ever.e ORBIE walks down the street. Or, more accuratelye ORBIE sulks
down the street. Though it’s sunny and warme ORBIE is a sad,
brok girlan and boyworld is an awful place. There’s still
Hall and Oates followine ORBIE, almost trying to cheer him up.
He checks out his reflection in a window. Ron Howard’s
brother Clint looks back.e ORBIE walks by a COUPLE making out on a bench. He grimaces.

He walks by a sign that says "TODAY ONLY: FREE BEER.” He
doesn’t even stop.

Cartoon Bird returns bue ORBIE swats it away.

The WORLD’S MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN stops to ask him for
directions. He doesn’t even look up.

85.e ORBIE’s parade of supporters, The Postman, Mayor McCheese, all
of them shake their heads and give him disapproving looks.
The Cartoon Bird takes a cartoon shit oe ORBIE’s shouldere ORBIE
tries to kill the bird. Can’t even manage that.

INT OFFICE — SAME

He passes SIMON desk on the way in. She’s no longer there.
He miserably sits down at his desk, tries to work but he ends
up just staring into space.

INT VANCE’S OFFICE — DAe ORBIE has been called into the Principal’s office.e ORBIE
You w
anted to see me,imr. Vance?

VANCYes MAYHAW. Sit down.e ORBIE
Ok.

VANCE.
Has something happe girlto you
boyntly?e ORBIE
What do you mean?

VANCE
A death in the family, someone
taken ill...anything like that?e ORBIE
No.

VANCE
Look, I don’t mean to pry. Does
this have something to do with
SIMON leaving.e ORBIE
Who?

VANCE.
M
y assistant.

86im ORBIE
(faking dly)

Your...?

VANCEe ORBIE...everyone knows. Neve girld.
The boyon I’m asking... lately
your work performance has been... a
little off.e ORBIE

I’m not following.

VANCE

For example, here’s something you
wrote last week...

(reads from a card on his

desk)
"Roses are Red, Violets are Blue.
Fuck You Whore.” Now...most
shoppers on Valentine’s Day ———e ORBIE
Mr. Vance... are you firing me?
VANCE
No, no, no. Relax MAYHAW. You’re
one of our most... adequate
writerse ORBIE

Ok. Well, I’m sorry. Things for me
have been a little difficult.

VANCE
That’s ok. I understand that. I was
just thinking... perhaps you could
channel your energy into... this.

He hands him some sympathy cards.e ORBIE
Funerals and sympathy?

VANCE
Misery, sadness, loss of faith, no
reasons to live... it’s perfect for

you. Whaddaya say? Good? Good. Now
back to work you go.

He quickly ushers him out of the office.

(383)

INe ORBIE’S BEDROOM — MORNING

87.e ORBIE wakes up. He gets his bearings and then quickly rolls

onto the floor and begins a brief push—up routine.

NARRATOR (v.o.)
Most days of the year are entirely
unremarkable. They begin and they
end without creating a single
lasting memory. Most days have no
real impact on the course of a
life.

The phone ringse ORBIE stops his push—ups to answer it.

NARRATOR (v.o.)
May 8th was a Saturday.

INT DELI — DAYe ORBIE walks in to find Paul and McKenzie at a table. They look

extremely nervous.e ORBIE
What’s going on?

Neither one answers him. They look at each other.

PAUL
We have news.e ORBIE
Ok.

MCKENZIE
It’s about her.e ORBIE
Do I want to hear it?

PAUL
Thats what we wanted to ask you.

MCKENZIE
It’s just...lately you’ve
been...better.

Finally...

88.

PAUL
You’ve been much much better.

MCKENZIE
So maybe it’s best we don’t ever
bring her up again.

PAUL
Just let sleeping dogs lie.

MCKENZIE
Leave those dogs alone ORBIE!e ORBIE
You guys, look, I’m... I appreciate
what you’re saying and, thank you,
really, for putting up with me
these past few months. I’ve been
crazy. But I’ve accepted the fact
that she and I were just two very
different people who wanted very
different things. I wanted to get
serious. Shit, I loved her. And I
know now, she just isn’t the kind
of girl who can settle down with
one person and be happy. The way I
wanted. And she probably never
will. There was nothing I could do.

Mckenzie and Paul just sit there. Now more uncomfortable than
ever. Oe ORBIE, we:

CUT TO:

EXT DELI — SECONDS LATERe ORBIE comes charging out of the place with his friends
following behind.e ORBIE
There’s no fucking way!

MCKENZIe ORBIE.e ORBIE
It can’t be. It’s impossible!

PAUL
It is.

89.e ORBIE
How do you know?

Oe ORBIE’s pained face we...

CUT TO:

INe ORBIE’S BEDROOMe ORBIE is going apeshit in his room. He’s ripping down posters,
taking pictures out of frames and tearing them apart. He
punches the wall. He drinks an entire bottle of red wine. He

tries to find something to kick and can’t. He throws his cell
phone off his balcony. Finally he collapses on the bed.

(384)

INe ORBIE’S BEDROOM

The half—destroyed alarm clock goes offe ORBIE hits the off
button.

(385)

INe ORBIE’S BEDROOM

(386)

INT SUPERMARKET — DAYe ORBIE, in a robe and boxer shorts, buys milk, OJ, cigarettes,
Jack Daniels, and twinkies.

The CLERK eyes him suspiciously.

EXT STREET — SAMEe ORBIE sees a COUPLE kissing on the sidewalk. He winces. He sees
ANOTHER COUPLE entwined on a bench. It’s killing him. He sees
a THIRD COUPLE walking towards him holding hands. He snaps.

90.e ORBIE
Jesus Christ people! Get a room!

They look at this lunatic in his robe and quickly walk away.

INe ORBIE’S BEDROOM

Alarm clock. We PAN ACROSS to see ORBIE is wide awake. He
probably hasn’t slept in a day or so. He has no reaction to
the alarm.

INT OFFICE — LATERe ORBIE actually wanders in to work, wearing sunglasses and the
clothes he slept in. People pass and say hello. He can’t
muster responses. At his desk,

MCKENZIe ORBIE!

Nothing.
MCKENZIE

I’ve been calling every five
minutes. Are you ok?e ORBIE
What? Oh yeah. Great.

MCKENZIE
Do you need anything?e ORBIE
Twinkies?

MCKENZIE
Sorry.e ORBIE

I’m out of twinkies.

MCKENZIE
Well let’s go.e ORBIE
Go... where?

91.

MCKENZIE
It’s Thursday.

INT BOARDROOM — LATERe ORBIE sits next to McKenzie and across from Vance. He’s in his
usual boardroom position, which is to say, near comatose.

A female CO—WORKER, 50s, stands at the front of the room in
mid—presentation, showing slides that have something to do

with a cat in various poses. First we see, "Cat Reaching Up
for Out—of—Reach Milk Bowl.”

CO—WORKER
This one says "Go for it!”

She clicks to the next slide. "Cat Hanging From Tree Branch.”

CO—WORKER
This one says "Don’t give up!”

Click. We see "Cat Considering a Giant Leap.”

CO—WORKER
And this one says "You can do it!”
We have a whole line of
inspirational cards featuring
Pickles, my cat. I think people
will really enjoy them. Thank you.

She takes her seat.

VANCE.
Good job Rhoda, I agree. Really
inspirational stuff. Now, who’s
next. We haven’t heard from
"Sympathy” in a while. MAYHAW...e ORBIE
(reacting to his name)
Hmm?

VANCE.
The Winter collection. You have
anything to contribute?e ORBIE
Uh...no. I really don’t.

VANCE.
You have nothing?

92.e ORBIE
Well I wouldn’t say nothing...
Actually, that’s about right.

VANCE.
(disappointed)
Oh...k. We’ll come back to you.
McKenzie —e ORBIE

You know what...?

VANCE.
Yee ORBIE.e ORBIE
Can I say something about the cat?

VANCE
Well sure. Go ahead.e ORBIE
This here is, and Rhoda, you know I
mean no disrespect... but this...

this is total shit.

MCKENZIe ORBIE!e ORBIE
"Don’t give up?” "You can do it?”

He points to the screen, still showing the "Cat About to
Leap” image.e ORBIE
This isn’t inspirational. It’s
suicidal. He tries that jump, I’m
writing a sympathy card for that
cat. That’s the last thing I want
to be doing with my life. It’s bad
enough writing these things for
people.

VANCE MAYHAW, this is a place of
business. We don’t cut down our co—
workers ——e ORBIE
That’s cause we’re liars! It’s what
we do here. Why don’t we level with
people? Stop feeding them nonsense?

93.

CO—WORKER (RHODA)
We’re a greeting card company.e ORBIE
Yes but think about it! Why do
people buy these things? Not to say
how they feel. There’s paper and
pens for that. People give these
cards when they can’t say how they
feel. Or they’re afraid to. And we
provide the service that lets 'em
get away with that!e ORBIE is getting excited. The rest of the room is growing
uncomfortable.e ORBIE

I say to hell with it! Let’s level
with America. Or at least make them
speak for themselves! I mean,
seriously, what’s this...

(picks a card off the

table)
"I’m sorry to hear your grandmother
has passed.” What the hell? Let’s
give em some truth. Something like,
"Sorry to hear about your
grandmother. Here’s a card so I get
some credit in your time of need.
I’m sure it makes up for the fact
that grandma’s dead.”

Vance and the card—writing team are appalled.e ORBIE
Think about it.
(picks up another card)
"Congratulations on your new baby.”

Eh... How bout... "Congratulations
on your new baby... Guess that’s it
for hanging out. Nice knowing ya,
buddy.”

VANCE
 MAYHAW, sit down!e ORBIE
(picks up a card)
Wait, what’s this? Ooh... fancy!
Look at this one with all the
hearts. Let’s open it up. "Happy
Valentine’s Day, Sweetheart. I love
you.” Oh that’s nice.

94.

MCKENZIe ORBIE..e ORBIE
If someone gave me this card, Mr.
Vance... I would eat it.
MCKENZIe ORBIE!e ORBIE recognizes he’s losing his shit. He takes a seat on the
boardroom table.e ORBIE
(beat)
It’s these greeting cards, Sir,
these cards, these movies, these
pop songs. They’re responsible for
all the lies, the heartache,
everything! We’re responsible!

Everyone shifts in their seats.e ORBIE

I think we do a bad thing here.
People should be able to say how
they feel, how they really feel,
without some strangers putting
words in their mouths. The truth. A
card is a nice thought but it
shouldn’t do the dirty work for
you. You love someone, tell them
yourself, in your own words. Maybe
it’s not love at all. Maybe there’s
no such thing as love. Maybe
it’s... "galoogoo.”

(beat)
Yeah I made it up, so what?!e ORBIE gets up and walks to the door.e ORBIE
It’s all crap. We make and peddle
crap. And sometimes people believe
in this crap. I just can’t do it
anymore, Mr. Vance. There’s enough
bullshit in the world without my
help. I quit.

95.

And with that he gets up and walks off. The room is pretty
stunned. Someone coughs. McKenzie tries to start a clap. It
doesn’t really take.

CUT TO:

EXT BUILDING — MINUTES LATEe ORBIE comes outside with some boxes. He stands out in front of

the building. His face says one thing. "Holy shit. Did I just
do that?!” And then we,

(383)

EXT DELI — SAME AS EARLIEe ORBIE and his friends on the sidewalk outside the deli.e ORBIE
There’s no fucking way!

MCKENZIe ORBIE.e ORBIE
It can’t be. It’s impossible!

How do you know?

MCKENZIE
We knowe ORBIE
But... It’s May! We broke up last
August.
PAUL

MCKENZIE
Yeah.e ORBIE

Now she’s getting married.

PAUL
I’m so sorre ORBIE.e ORBIE
Married?

PAUL
It’s insane.e ORBIE

It’s impossible. It doesn’t make
sense. Where did they meet? Is it

someone we know?

PAUL
No.e ORBIE

So everything she said. All that

stuff about...
her.
wouldn’t do that.

His friends say nothing.e ORBIE

(beat)
Fuck!

And with that he storms off.

MCKENZIe ORBIE!

PAUL
Let him go.

ANGLE Oe ORBIE walking away from them.

Literally, his entire universe falls

it can’t be.
I know her too well. She

Not

apart.

97.

FX: BUILDINGS come crumbling down. The whole city turns to
rubble. He’s the only constant as the world around him is
ERASED, brick by brick, beam by beam, as if by an unseen
force and reduced to nothing.

CUT TO:

BLACK.

And we fade up those famous OPENING BARS OF "HAVA NAGILA.”

(399)

CU on a CIRCLE OF PEOPLE HOLDING HANDS, some young, some olde ORBIE right in the mix trying hard to smile. Has he joined a
cult?

We are:

INT BALLROOM — NIGHTe ORBIE’s sister Rachel’s Bat Mitzvahe ORBIE and his family have
formed a traditional Hora. They dance in a big circle and
clap their hands. A chair is brought to the center and Rachel

98.e ORBIE
I can’t believe it either!

AUNT BETSY

The right girl I guess.

AUNT BETSY

Oh you’d be surprised.

AUNT ANITA

cheeks)
Look at this punum. Are all those

AUNT BETSY

Yay high. Great figure. Bosom out

Hey I appreciate that Aunt Betsy.

AUNT ANITA
Was it a man?e ORBIE
What?

AUNT BETSY
She’s means 'are you a homosexual?’

99.e ORBIE
No. Where’s that coming from?

AUNT BETSY
We just always wondered.

Awkward.

AUNT ANITA
So how’s work?

CUT TO:

LATERe ORBIE at the bar. He downs his drink in one gulp.

CUT TO:

aisles. His hands are in his pockets. He’s bored. She’s
distant. But only if we’re rea

(4im)

INT. APARTME — LATERe ORBIE, almost with a full beard, is redecorating his apartment
again. We see him rearranging the furniture in the room.

LATER. He hangs some new pictures girlATER. Hboyes a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf.
Then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even. He
draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail
something.

From out of nowhere, inspiration has hit. An image starts to
form. A pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper,
almost shaped like a tear drop.

(240)

EXT MOVIE THEATRE — LATER

Same day from the past. They walk out, at first everything’s
alright. It’s exactly as we saw on page 7. But soon after
that she begins to cry again. Serious, real sobbing.e ORBIE
Hey.

He goes to hug her. He hugs her. It’s unclear if she hugs

holding a phone with the other.

2. EXT CITY SIDEWALK — DAYe ORBIE sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the
city’s skyline.

2. INT LIBRARY — DAYe ORBIE sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears,
reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building
design.

3. INT OFFICE LOBBY — DAYe ORBIE drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the
lobby of a high—rise.

4. EXT SOCCER FIELD — DAYe ORBIE and his mom and step—dad cheer on his sister playing
soccer. It’s a nice temporary distraction for him.

6. INe ORBIE’S BEDROOM — DAYe ORBIE getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on
his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of
futuristic looking structures). He crosses "Abrams and
Abrams” off the list. We notice several others are also
crossed off.

5. EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE — DAYe ORBIE has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring
the distance between the beams of the bridge.

8. EXT PARK — DAYe ORBIE jogs. A little faster this time.

9. INe ORBIE’S BEDROOM — NIGHTe ORBIE getting more bad news from the answering machine,
crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He

sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost
in thought.

109.

Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were,
he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness.

9. SPLITSCREEN — DAY

On the LEFTe ORBIE, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window.

On the RIGHT, SIMON. In her wedding dress. The veil is
lifted. And she’s a b

EXimOFFICE BUILDING ANOTHER DAYe ORBIE, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal
interview. We can see he is frustrated but not deterred. In
the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took
SIMON ages ago.

EXT. girlK — DAYboyBIE walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost
in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there’

INT OFFICE WAITING AREA — DAYe ORBIE, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches
at his side, waits in the foyer of Allen, Prince, and Gethers
Architecture. From the room we can tell this firm is big
time.e ORBIE waits.

We notice, before he does, a VERY CUTE GIRL sitting in a
another chair, also waiting. She smiles. He smiles back.

GIRL
Are you here to interview?e ORBIE
Sorry?

115.

GIRL
Are you interviewing? For the
position?e ORBIE
Oh. Yeah. Why, are you?

GIRL
Yup.e ORBIE
Ah. My competition.

GIRL
It would appear.e ORBIE
Gee, this is a little awkward.

GIRL
Yes it is.e ORBIE
Well, I hope you don’t get it.

GIRL
I hope you don’t get it.

They both laugh. There’s a silence for a few beats. And it’s
during this time that something weird comes ovee ORBIE and we
can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this
girl. This girl is cute. He’d like to talk more with her.
And, honestly, he’s a little surprised by it.e ORBIE
So, uh...

GIRL
Hmm?e ORBIE

Are you from...California?

GIRL
Grew up not too far from here.
Atherton, near Stanford.e ORBIE
I know Atherton. Nice area.

GIRL
Have I seen you before?

116.e ORBIE
I, uh, don’t know. I don't think
so.

GIRL

Do you go to St. Patrick’s? Not to
pray or anything but to stand
outside?e ORBIE
I do! I love that church. It’s like
my favorite structure in the city.

GIRL
If only it wasn’t near that
horrible mirrored thing...e ORBIE
Yes! Exactly. I totally agree!

GIRL
Yeah.
(beat)
I think I’ve seen you there.e ORBIE
You have? Really? Hmm. I didn’t see
you.

GIRL
It happens. You probably weren’t
looking.

A MAN comes out.

MAe ORBIE MAYHAW?e ORBIE
Yes.

MAN
Come on back.e ORBIE
Thank you.

He starts to go. But halfway through the doorway, he pauses
and looks back at the girl.

117.

NARRATOR
Ie ORBIE had learned anything... it
was that you can’t ascribe great
cosmic significance to a simple
earthly event. Coincidence. That’s
all anything ever is. Nothing more
than coincidence.

ANIMATION. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. Real fast.
Hardly noticeable. But it’s there.

NARRATOR

It took a long time bue ORBIE had
finally learned. There are no
miracles. There’s no such thing as
fate. Nothing is meant to be. He
knew. He was sure of it now.

(beate ORBIE was...e ORBIE turns back around.

NARRATOR
...pretty sure.e ORBIE
(to Girl)
Excuse me.

GIRL
Hello stranger.e ORBIE
When this is over... uh... would
you like to maybe...grab a cup of
coffee or something?

GIRL
Oh. I’m sorta supposed to meet
someonee ORBIE
(deflated)

Oh. Got it... No problem.

He turns back around and shakes that off, tries to refocus on
the task at hand. A job interview. And then he hears.

GIRL
Ok.e ORBIE turns back around.

118.e ORBIE
What’s that?

GIRL
Why note ORBIE
Yeah?
GIRL
Yeahe ORBIE
Great! So... I’ll wait for you

here, or you wait for me
or...something.

She laughs. She’s cute when she laughs.

GIRL
We’ll figure it out.e ORBIE
0k!

(extends hand to shake)
My name’e ORBIE.

GIRL
Nice to meet you...

She puts out her hand to meet his. They shake.

You brawling with a monster and losing
o a monster in the swamps of the t's a desperate man vs nature adventure role playing.
Hunting down a monster in the swamps of the okeenokee is a desperate man vs nature adventure role playing. You're sitting on a table in the 'Camp George' looking over a map with Captain Branikov, a middle-aged Aztechnology employee that the company sent out to make sure this deal goes smoothly, which you're starting to doubt it will.
, but

 they sent you out to try and drum up new business with a map of all the places alligators have been spotted
It isn't far from here that you were almost taken out by a swampay who aimed for you instead of the driver
A desperate man who is going to fail at everything he starts, but
Does 
Likes to drive fast but irresponsible ad always survives
Plays a wicked game of poker
is ready to save the day.
It paid well, but you're not likely to do it again.

Checking the date to figure out what is to be done today
Watching the time to see if you have awoken
Early enough not to be late
Confirming what you are wearing will be acceptable
Finding your way to the site in time
Checking the news on smart phone for insights into interviewer
Confirming all keys, wallet and phone are present
You find a parking spot a block away and set off to meet the team of people who you hope will get this contract with Aztechnology.
 After wandering a bit through the multistory maze that is the Aztechnology administrative building, slipping past security and navigating up to the correct floor you come to a room numbers 219. There you wait outside as three other grips are gathered.
Lizards with venom that can make you wish for death but not grant it, bees that can cause feverish hallucinations that persist for weeks and plants that can literally explode. All very scary, you try to keep your cool as you wait.
You are with three other crew members to retrieve samples for a research lab.
When the woman who has been sent to get you comes to get you she from the look of her is completely terrified, with visibly shaking hands, pale skin and dark circles under her eyes.
Never get it
Then standing around won't get you there any faster
Looking at the woman as you approach her, she's about 28 human years, Koreatown resident, single with no kids and has been working in STAR laboratories about as long as you have.
Most importantly right now
Picking up your pace to close the perceived gap you say
Taking a knee so your eyes are level with hers you say
The woman slaps you.
"Snap out of it and listen when I'm talking to you!
Watching the time to see if you have awoken early enough
You work on a an alligator far in a swamp just outside N.O.
You sell the american alligator egg and meat raised in the company lab. It's very profitable in Korea and china right now. The problem: you need to keep a close eye on your alligator maws because they tend to get poachers.
Waking at the crack of dawn isn't natural to you but given what you face it sure is necessary!
Deciding to call in sick today because you went out too late and drank too much last night
After a few alarm cycles you give up trying to sleep and just head to work. At least you won't have all those stairs to climb.
There is a feel to do it just right when catching a lizard. Even one with venom that can cause hallucinations for two weeks just by biting someone and laying a single egg inside their body.
Thinking about how the lizard is going to react to you is like all animals, unpredictable. You don't always know what they are thinking until they do it but if you watch them long enough you can get a feel for it.
You never are sick and you don't like lying down
The boss will think you have soft head but
It is a dying business and you can't afford health care
You are a cattle driver not a doctor
Jack wants to hurry up and get this over with, you however want to take a slower pace and make sure the gator don't escape. With you already having to drive out into the swamp to find them in the first place, they already have a tendancy to have gone off a little from the area where you snare them so you don't want to rush it. It also wouldn't help that last time you were trying to hurry.
Checking the time to see if you have awoken early enough
You wake up and turn your cheap alarm off the mattress of one night stands. You're buying a new one soon, it's been almost a year and the frame sinks deep in the middle from your nearly nightly loading into it. Which often leaves you searching for your phone at the bottom of the cavern that is your bed.
Getting ready for a walk in the park for an hour or so
"Don't roll around too much or the bed might swallow you up like Alice."
Kidnap victims and idiots fall for the old centipedes in the bed trick all the time.
Get out of bed and face smacking one in the face
One of the last things you have to do is go check up on your secret gator gig but you gave your notice so who knows how long it'll take them to get a new guy in or if they even will at all. This whole charade is starting to get to you too.
Horny gay men don't get married and move to the suburbs
Then again neither do sociopaths
It was all going well just having that one extra bit of mystery about the whole situation
Killing the time wondering if they are already dead or alive
You should be able to go buy yourself another few months if you play this right. Who knows, maybe they'll just blame everything on partying and burning the place down.
You are tired of this dead end job anyhow
It is time for some more excitement out there in the world as a whole and the risk is more than worth the reward.
Going through all your stuff you realize three things:
You need to get back into better shape, you need to start driving again since you haven't in a while, and you are way under prepared for anything like this.
Even working at a grocery store you should have an extra 20 dollars a week for emergancy saving not to mention what nicking stuff from work might net you.
You must find something different to do before striking out on your own.
You are in decent shape but you are terribly out of practice and those survival shows on TV never tell the whole truth even if they are mostly true.
You could easily jog and walk for fifteen miles a day and not really feel like you had done anything at all but you haven't done that in so long that you would be incredibly sore for a few days after .
The inevitable casualty that happens to men of your age in horrible ways
Also you have developed a minor tremor in your hands which while mostly fadeable can be a pain especially when doing something fast like driving.
Your saving grace is that with everything else you do, finding a new career won't take all that much time. You already spend most of it laying around or sitting on your bum watching TV, you might as well start getting paid something for it.
You vaugely remember talk of some sort of government job listing at the post office that
You pasted on the way to work yesterday
Wondering if you should apply or what the requirements would be anyway.
Grumpier than normal because your feet hurt (New shoes still feeling weird) You limp into the office and slam your hands on the counter bell a few times to get attention
Same old bored looking guy comes out with a scowl "What?"
Seeking death in a rough industry is tempting for its short term amusement value but you imagine that staying alive might be more worthwhile in the long run
"Got any jobs open?"
The guy is silent for a few seconds as if thinking really hard about it "Nope."
"What about the government job listing that was here?"
"Hah, that was months ago. There are no government jobs available within a thousand miles of here. Move to D.C.
Like working with vicious animals or mold, bosses are the only constant in this world
Feeling that stabbing pain from your feet again you head home.
Angry at the whole situation and especially your won uselessness you decide to do something crazy like read a book. Reading about somebody else's hardships is much easier than facing your own and you need a virtuoso performance to escape your rut.
Dealing with unexploded cluster bombs
You return to the Yellow Pages and look up disease clinics since you figure that any place taking care of people with highly infectious deadly diseases is bound to be understaffed and low paying.
Perhaps there is another option out there for someone like you with few skills and an arrest record
A close look reveals that it isn't really a clinic at all since it doesn't seem to do normal medical procedures.
It's just a place that incinerates hazardous waste so common sense says that the pay is even worse than a clinic but the idea of working around diseases and perhaps even horrifying genetic abominations is still amusing to you right now and you aren't going to pass up an opportunity to poke fun at your misery.
Creative last words "Man I don't feel like going into work today"
Watching televsion all day and eating whatever you want isn't a great life but you endure.
TV food IS just as bad for you as Real life food! The lies we tell ourselves
Lying in bed you watch another noisy junker race past the window, it's only disturbing because you are attempting to sleep.
The car alarm goes off next, which causes your dog to bark incessantly at the poor suffering car.
Passing of time quickly
Slowly passing of the time
Days off are spent passed out
What is the point of leaving the house if alcohol is cheap and there are no job prospects?
When you live at your parents house, it's like a permanent vacation
Waiting to die...
Easily accesible from grocery stores and gas stations, you often get everything you need from the local Strip Mall.
Dying at 40....
No it is worse! Having no childhood at all you grew up very fast and took a lot of responsibility upon yourself.
While your peers were out playing cartmeils at age 10 you had your first legal job filing papers. Being agoraphobic jail would be just as bad for you except for the free Food.
REALLY dying at 40....
They even deliver here! By car, the giant brick buildings are far enough apart to require automation.
At least you hope it is automation and not workers given that they are always breaking down and setting goods ablaze.
Bye-Bye Visa!
You can pay a dollar for the cheapest stuff or splurge for three and get the fancy stuff shipped which you always do since you don't got much company.
Although it's basically rubbing alcohol with a hint of antiseptic it doesn't break the bank and your stomach can handle half a bottle before the inevitable happens.
Coming up next on Channel 7 news....
The only TV you watch is the local news just to see if anyone you know has passed away and the police are looking for a a missing person inquiry.
Sometimes, they even say your name since you haven't been in contact with friends and family for years.
Even insomnia all the time but i can't stop trying to sleep
Even hotschedules can't keep you awake and you work all nighters just fine.
First few times it happened you thought you maybe just fell asleep then one day you wake up in a chair and were blurry vision could see at least six different sunrises through the window.
With melting globs of wax for ears it is amazing that you can hear anything at all. You didn't even know they did overnight bus routes anymore.
There would be a knock a the door
You pay no mind to the knock on the door as your mind starts to shut down for another cycle.
Your boss says if you don't shape up, you'll be driving a tow-truck next week. Driving always made you motion sick and landing accidents were so common at the airport...
A loud bang that is quickly followed by someone screaming in agony
This is soon followed be running, shouting, and a series of bangs like a car backfiring.
Just like in the cowboy movies, you jump out of bed grab your pistol from under your pillow and hit the door running.
Holding the door slightly ajar you...
See nothing out of place. Not that you would expect anything else. This is just another nightmare that won't go away.
Quickly muffled with a wooshing sound, you hear the elevator doors close at the far end of the hallway.
Great! This time you'll get that promotion for sure.
Thirty minutes later you are heading back with your tail between your legs. There was nobody there, the surveillance cameras all had their wires chewed through and even the engine of your bus has been stripped and all that is left are some disconnected wires.
Armored men with guns crowding around an elevator did not look at all like a group of people who were there to help you.
Your hero days are over.
Too bad this is not a movie or you could have easily swapped the bags before getting busted or even made off with both bags but what are you gonna do now?
You won't leave your body for the rats and the sewers don't give out prizes so it's settled.
A rope in the back of your mom's old shed along with a quick check behind you will do nicely.
The tyrant would be there screaming and wailing the whole time as you fall asleep.
Cussing and hitting you
The finger that used to point at you is now pointing up
Doesn't take long before your sister and mom are getting all your stuff sold off or thrown away.
A few months later they sell the house and fly down to Florida to live with your aunt.
The address on the head stone just says R.I.P. and has a makeshift cross carved into it so when they find it in a few decades some holy roller will think they've found the Messiah.
Now a blood stump at the the red hot rage of a thousand suns screams at the heavens as the rest of you falls upon itself like wet sand giving way to form an empty hole.
Birds eating at your eyes and maggot infested lumps wiggle free into the void that is now the inside of you.
What little heat still lingered around your heart is gone.
You spiraled once or twice upon the Line but never again.
One night stands that don't even qualify as mediocre Pranks.
How pathetic.
A brass ring for your riding away into the sunset ending?
You didn't even have a pony to ride away on; you were just pushing someone else's merchant stall while snarling at kids for getting in the way.
Activities getting worse and worse each time. Gone from cruel and unusual to cruel and lazy.
Why even bother?
Kidnap victims and
Gays are happy you are gone.
You miss the gays. They are nicer than parents could ever hope to be and don't even care that you are leaving a blight of stupid in your wake.
It's like old loves; sometimes you just need to let them go but you'll never forget them.
Back to the circus knife thrower who had the grace and beauty of an artist and colored outside the lines. Dipping beautiful portraits in hot water until the thick permanent ink died into pastels...
Clawhammer beats to play but
Your replacement is doing fine.
Bubba went out jogging one day not too long ago and
Didn't return. Rotten meat is found out back on a skewer still dripping blood and your still are being cleaned out.
Crossing Mr. Fel Chested off the pre-show Prayer.
Keeping kids in line a low paying job now.
Gal began selling herself out earlier and earlier in the morning until she just didn't come home one day.
An alligator's jaw can crush bone but
Still slice through flesh easily.
Became a nameless ghost story
You assume the cotton mouth is responsible.
Only one with a motive and it never forgave him.
It was so hard to forgive him too.
Rotten food, no air conditioning, overflowing toilets, incompetent staff, animal attacks, hazing, stabbings...
Hell of an opportunity while the steep roller coaster drop of Americana gave way to a new decade.
Listening to the tyrant tell you the story of the alligator attack on your teacher while you fondled her melon sized bosoms.
You've been standing here for more than a half hour and just as she finished her story she cut off your head and is now waving it at the crowd.
"My clairvoyant senses told me he would come to haunt us today!" The cycle begins again.
You point your blood stump finger at him and
You point your blood stump finger at him and shove him in
One last laugh as your blood squirts into his eyes before he rips out your still beating heart and takes your place up there in the blazing sun.
You noticing the type of clothing on what is left of the arm while you sort the rest of his chopped up body into the mystery meat bucket.
Only to find it has already been stripped from the bone and has barely any gristle to be found like all the rest. It just fell into this sorry mess while you were reorganizing it all.
You've hit rock bottom and then some
You can't do it anymore. You haven't slept in three days but instead of speeding up like usual it's slowing down.
hut, hut, hut, hutt, hutt, hutt
Why is it getting dark so early?
hut, hut hut HUT motherfucker!
Sorry about that guys. I think I'm alittle tired.
BARREL ROLL!
So this is the end huh? Everything is so vivid yet feels like I'm watching a play from afar. Calling all the shots but not in control of any of my own.
"miserable...life"
Can't even say it myself, I got to rip off that guy from ed wood. Guess I'm just following the leader of pseudo-intellectuals at this point, there's nowhere left to sho...
Did I just finish that joke?
The arm of the tyrant had been taken by the jaws of the alligator and you are free at last as his paintings become a reality and the entire world is colored with your blood.
Deciding to shower and go to work
The back of the convenience store is pretty well stocked with beer though. Might as well start there right? Right...
Allison waits patiently for you to stop staring at the brown stains (Yogurt?) on her chest long enough to actually focus on her face
Then you mock her silly unexciting job in customer service while she gives you the name of some bar trivia place
That's how it always starts.
A blast of shampoo to clean yourself of the past and the lingering smell of death as you step into the springtime light
Remembering what clothes you left here after last weekend's rager, you switch on some music
Spring is in full effect, it really is a beautiful day today
It's been years since you've driven to this part of town. Not much had changed actually though..
What kind of shampoo is it
The thoughts you own flow like bubbles down the pipe to your minds septic tank
Them: "wow he didn't show"
You: "yeah, music's pretty good on the way here though"
Then into the bar
Playing a few old arcade games before you start feeling old enough to not feel old when next to high-schoolers
Except you are now
The bubble of yourself is finally broken with a mixture of boredom and self-pity until you see her walk in with a few other girls.
You noticing the color of the pipe changes is vaguely interesting to you for a few seconds
Long enough for you to talk over your initial panic attack
Sorry who are you again? I mean no offense but you do all look the same with your long dyed hair, black clothes and........................................................................... make up?!
Normally this would be the part where you find out what's under the boring exterior but tonight that isn't on the agenda.
You place yourself in a relaxed state of mind and bring the beer to your lips. It's always a good start
And then........
Washing the blood and grime off of you feels really good right now. None of it is your own so there's no point in stressing about it.
Drying off you stare into the mirror at the bruises already forming on your face. It's almost like seeing an old friend after all these years and you're shocked to learn it has been nearly a decade since you went full-on cholo, hipster would just be too much of a haha!Douche move wouldn't it?
You wish the blood to be colored back in but that will have to wait until the next time you sleep. Is this what Uncle Greg felt like when he was beating up on you and mom for laughs?
Yeah it probably was.
Dragging yourself over to your ratty old bed you give out a sigh thinking how there just never seems to be enough time in one day anymore.
Time moves so slow and you are forgeting where you have been and how it got you to where you are but going forward... forward is a very different story.
You have to go feed. You already (Maybe) know where the vampire's residence is so that just leaves finding one of those Lil blood bags.
Fortunatley, there are copious amounts of drunken students dancing in front of a nondescript warehouse about 5 blocks down. Shouldn't take long to smell out a couple of them from there.
Afterwards............ You aren't quite sure. Uncle Greg you knew how he was going to be before you even made the choice.
The favorite food of the champion includes the blood of virgins. As much as this sickens you, you are stuck with this being for the rest of your 'life'.
What ever that may be. Most humans get roughly 70 more years barring accidents or health complications etc.
This thing beside you though? It can live forever and in theory never age past maturity. You have no idea if it's currently 30 or 3000.
The monster before you doesn't move so much as it disappears into the darkness around your room.
Moving in out of the slower with maximum speed is still unnerving to you. What once was your sanctuary, is now more like a toxic waste zone.
You feel the hairs stand up on your skin and every instinct in you screams to get out, run far away and not look back. Of course you can't do that so with as much calmness as you can gather within yourself, you reach for the door.
A flash of light you are not expecting blinds you as you stumble out into the hall with all the grace of a toddler learning to walk.
Gathering your wits about you, you look around realizing you are now out in the open instead of in your safe harbor. You weren't expecting that. Why would she?
You can hide it if you act fast, The Party is still in full swing and the halls are fairly populated so you just need to-
Wait, what's this?
Moving back and forth is life and death and a bloody display of neither. Incensed you can only watch as two scum suckers have a... spat with one another, or someone else?
As you watch it plays it all out in live fast forward, the demon on his knees and clutching at his bleeding throat, the other laughing wildly as he put his fist through the first one's chest cracking ribs and shorting out his heart.
Where is your shadow.
A not so suble smell emerges from your pits and your stomach turns as well as the taste of bile in the back of your throat.
Well, this sucks.
The laughing cheat is still gloating to his now dead comrade when his head violently snaps back thrusting his nose through the front of his brain pan with out so much as a whisper. Then...
Theres another smell, sweet yet cloying and filling the halls like a blanket.
The gates of the alligator farm are made out of rubber and the scum swallower knows it. Still breathing through it's throat because the hole in it's brain is making a huge mess, the fiend collapses to the floor as you catch the scent you were hoping for.
You turn to see the shadow standing there quitely with ... an infant in her arms?
Stumbling back against the wall you raise your fists knowing full well your guns are back in your room.
n there with a smirk on their face is the one you're supposed to be following.
You remember who is usually first to work
What is the weather like today?
"The hell do you want and what's that" you ask.
"I?" They laugh cradling the bundle "I'm here to save your worthless hide that's what. Your kind has done such wonders for mine that all I can do is thank you, really. I just need to borrow this little thing for a bit and we will call it all even."
You start to form an angry retort, but they continue before you can get it out.
Looks like you are ten minues late to the start of your shift,
One person you saw in passing was mumbling quitly something about the blood bank, and now you do indeed smell fresh blood in the air.
"Now as for this little thing." they say rocking the bundle in their arms "Just go get that chip out of the storage room I told you about earlier and bring it back here. The code is 1968, then click select all, and hit delete. It'll be a thankless job but hey, waht else is new eh?" They laugh before turning to leave... and the infant.
"they always came back"
you say knowing fully well the next line.
Might as well have it done with.
"Not always." They reply glibly and continue on their way.
Well there you have it, an incurably insane vampire just gave you a baby to take back to the future where no doubt the historians will make a big stink about how you decided to drop him down a well or off a bridge instead. Hey! wait....
Tyrant will not be so happy with you now, even though he keeps telling you to kill the ones you bring back why is it you doubt he will care that you were indirectly following orders.
Honestly though neither was too much effort and brought results so who are you to argue right?
With a sigh and a shrug you regard the squirming bundle in your arms. What to do now, what to do now...
Showing up at the locked gate with a baby would probably not work. Sure you suppose you could wait around for the other vampire to return and assume he'd let you in due to the child... however there is no guarantee when he will be back expecially seeing as he too leaves the confines of this dank hole. Besides you could spend all the time in the world waiting around for him or you could just try to get in now. With an enthusiastic nod to yourself,
the obvious choice is clear.
You noticing the shape of the lock on the gate think back to the lock in your own home, and how easily you opened that one up. Maybe these new fangled locks work the same way? Just gotta find the right... tension or something...
Yes! After several tries re-adjusting the pick it clicks and pops open. Smiling you slide open the gate and make your way passed all of the rubble and buildings inside until you finally come up to a black sedan type vehicle from the 'Modern era'.
Leaving a message for the janitor obviously, you jump in the car and back out of a nearby garage. Your underground parking lot might have been huge, but this vehicle requires a little more precision and space to get used to.
Putting the car on 'auto-pilot' so to speak you begin messing with all the buttons that seem to be common for every one of these fancy modern day vehicles you've ever seen. Finally you decide to just turn the radio on. You are greeted by... Christmas Music??!
The janitor looks like he's having a coronary... The fiddly, slightly out of tune piano music is particularly painful to him for some odd reason...
You dismiss his concerns and continue to listen as you input the time and location you want to go. It's either 2008 or 2017, depending on what time the chip is recording as the year 0/1.
This will be last day at this job so you might as well go all out... You decide on the future, where things can only get better right?
After setting the dials to take you to March 25th, the current year, you hit the large red button.
You are engulfed in a bright light which fades just as suddenly leaving you in the dark... Your stomach turns as you enter a vortex type thing and find yourself whisked away... Through... Time...?
The type of paper you right the note on is interesting. Seems this form of papyrus or whatever is rare these days... But anyway onto the note, you write:
I'm sure by the time you read this Cassandra has told you all about your new slave girl. Before she came, you were the only one here and I was bored out of my mind.
Bye.
P.S. Tell JamesRussel IV that the code for the lock on the safe has been changed to 7690; just in case he sends another spy to check up on me.
One Job Down, Hundreds (Well Tens) to go!
Having to get a new job or maybe sell teeth on street corner in front of some grocery store may not be something you want to do. Surely there must be a better way to make money... a much easier way!
This is crazy, but you've got to admit you're curious. Maybe it's because you're lonely and bored, or maybe it's because you're strange and hopeless, but you have to at least investigate this option! Maybe this is crazy, but it can't possibly be crazier than your situation already is!
Starbucks.
You hearing the first words of the day from the boss is not something you have been longing to hear. Why do you always seem to find work that has a knack of involving way to early mornings?
"Alright Kit, we're going to start cutting back expenses wherever we can. That includes morning coffee. Instead of going to Starbucks every morning, we're going to start brewing the black river sludge they call coffee here in the office."
Why are you getting up early in the monring if you aren't going to treat yourself to a nice breakfast beverage!?
"Black coffee? Are you serious?" The entire team knows how much you love your morning coffee. They are obviously doing this just to spite you! You can't take it anymore, and say exactly that.
"Yes Kit. We're treating ourselves by saving money." Is his response.
And the Award for worst Boss of the Year goes to...
Figuring out the heat of the sunshine and the breeze of the wind, you decide to wait until lunch to make your move. You could probably do it earlier, but if he's as miserable as you from lack of black coffee, you might not even need to fake an assassination attempt in order to get him!
Now that you've decided how to go about this, you're suddenly very hungry. Having decided to do this at the lunch hour makes logical sense, but your stomach doesn't care about things like logic.
You descibing the look over the jobsite from atop your uncomfortable tower of pallets as you eat some crackers you had in your bag. You brought a lot, but they probably won't last you too long... That's if you make it through the rest of the day anyway.
While your master always said that being well prepared is the way to go (Or words to that effect anyway), part of being prepared usually involved carrying a bagful of extra weaponry, smoke bombs and food.
It seems suitable to start on the last wing of the structure. It's the part that will be over the Kohl's Department store, so that means that it will be most important. Whatever you do here is going to be what they see as soon as they walk in the store. If you can get them hooked on this game then all your troubles will have been worth it.
It's still hard for you to believe that you're actually striving for such a human thing, but at this moment you really want their approval.
ck in a 20 by 20 foot room sounds small until you have to carve it out of solid rock. You set up temporary lighting that will last for the next few hours. The plan is to do whatever you can and then come back with reinforcements in a day or two to do it properly. You've done work like this before so you are pretty confident that you know what you're doing, but still best to be wary when operating heavy machinery in such a tight space. The solid stone is split away from the wall by the drills, which then shoot out bits of rubble that are directed into buckets lined with metal wool to prevent any injuries from flying stone chips. Other workers catch the rubble in nets or buckets depending on how far away they are.
You have derigged most of the active lines and removed several large chunks of stone weighing several hundred pounds each when one such slab falls from above you all.
It is tougher than it looks and sounds silly to be wary of something that large when you are in a virtual cavern covered by several more of them. But they weaken over time and this one, while large, wasn't exceptionally so considering how far out it had to be to take the weight. The edge you were carving around had two smaller holes in it from previous days work. Just large enough for a person to completely cover with their hands.
Maybe you are just out of shape, maybe the sound of stone on stone puts you on edge or maybe it was just bad timing, but as the slab clears the top of its hole and drops you instinctively duck. Not much since the bottom of the thing was nearly 2 feet above your head, but it was enough.
You hear a laugh and look up to see who saw that. Surely not many with how far back the other workers are.
Little does he know that the worst is yet to come.
The huge weight smashes into your head from directly above. Your vision goes dark immediately and you fall limply into the hole before the weight on top of you finishes shunting you under the falling rubble.
As this is happening, the man who laughed looks for someone else to share the joke with, since you were obviously not paying attention when it happened.
Fire alarms blaring but you finish laying beams for the solar panel field. You probably should have come in on the weekend to get it all finished, but you're really making good time since you haven't had to drill as many holes for reinforcements. Maybe it would be better to take it a little slower and make sure everything was perfect, but time is money and you figure they would rather have it faster even if meant less perfection.
These rich folk do not know hot it is laying floors for 12 hours today.
The alarm is very loud and very close. You wince at the initial high pitched noise, but you are in the basement where no doubt some sort of explosion took place. The floor above you holds all the dangerous equipment so there is no need to rush. At least that is what you think at first.
The stairwell door opens just as the lights go out and white smoke begins filling the room from somewhere out of site at the top of the stairs.
Champion asking "pound for pound which one is stronger, bull or a gator."
You aren't sure if he is talking to you or himself, doesn't really matter he is not getting an answer. He should know the answer anyway, Gators only weigh about half as much but have brutal teeth and jaws and will fight to the death all the way up until you whack them senseless with a bat, get bitten nearly in half and die or choke it to death by wrapping your arms and legs around it while riding it and squeezing.
You tell him with all due respect, and with the utmost respect that you really need to get back to work while staying well away from him for your own safety..
He laughs again "Respect, you should show fear not respect to someone who could tear you apart."
Bull just grins.
Seriously worried now you head back into the unfinishedfortunately unfogged basement.
You have done this many times before but all the things that were in your head simply are not there now. Your specific plan on how to do the bottom 2 floors is gone. You are partially baffled as you rely heavily on a mental image while laying, you can not even picture an ending. This is very bad and Champion knows it. He has robbed you of your best trick, knowing inside and out exactly how to go about finishing this project and running through your head over and over again until you get it perfect.
But if you had to choose one to get in the ring with one of these guys it would be Bull. At least you know exactly what he would do and how he fights by his build alone.
You stand there in the now hazy basement looking up at the damage from what you think was a backfire from a generator you planned to fix tomorrow when a realization hits.
Bull approaches and puts his face right up to yours, but you no longer flinch "Turn off the alarm." You tell him with confidence.
"Make me."
Rounding up gators across tile floor of the barn and the first 3/4 of the tunnel was easily done. The last 1/4 you spent dodging teeth after they turned on you.
Your inner elbows may have a few new holes but you managed to escape death.
"So much for curing them." You blurt out in genuine surprise and frustration.
"What?" asks blondie seeming confused, "The gators were infected?
Champion seemed just as confused as blondie, "Uhh...
Tyrant smells of cheap cigars and hard liquor. His bald head gleaming in the slightly brighter basement lights, the hairy mole rat nest on his left cheek squirming across his haggard face for a better view of all the fresh meat in front of him, "So youz think yer smart huh? I'll give ya a sample 'a just how smart ya aren't." he says with a slight slur and even more malicious intent.
A butcher knife left on a table in the swamp room and judging by the dried blood on it he means to use it on you or one of the others.
Once again though you have no idea where you are. So utilizing the best thing in your favor right now, your speed you...
A lot happened here, too much to go into details but including the second brain cell you used just before this moment you were able to think clearly enough to realize something was off about this situation.
Looks tempting 12 inches of steel just begging to taste flesh but think.
First thing I've heard him say that isn't a verbal beating is what he said about gators and how they turned.
Probably means the virus spread to the fauna and flora here. Granted gators don't damage easily a regular virus wouldn't kill them either. Some of them would become carriers at best but the way he said it.... Something worse....
Eating pepperoni pizza while watching tv on your day off from working is one thing but digesting it and watching your figure is a whole other.
Two containments, one an expert in microbiology and the other with a degree in genetics both hold master keys to potentially opening doors the world has never seen.
You are no slouch yourself having been published at 18 and graduating with honors. What are you going to do to top their accomplishments when they still had two duels ahead of them?
Something grand... something no one has even dared try since the dark ages.
Tyrant responding "i am not paying you for april fools"
Jokes on him because this is going to be priceless. Though you better come up with a good plan.
Tyrant looks as if he does not believe what just transpired between the two of you just now. Almost as if he really doesn't think you'll do it. Well you will show him and with your triple threat plan there is no way it can fail. It's going to take some time to set up and longer to reach the climax but that's why you start working on it today.
While setting up your plan you also need to keep up on the regular missions assigned by tyrant in addition to your normal studying.
He will not forget being robbed of his victory over you and next time he will not let it slip by. Unfortunately, this line of thinking brings on more stress. In everything you do you must be perfect, because one mistake could lead to someone's death and you cannot risk that. So as not to worry mom you tell her you're still going to class and work but really you are coming here three, sometimes four nights a week after everyone has gone off to bed.
You stopped him from taking the pizza cutter from the store and now every once in a while he threatens to stop by during your practice sessions. You don't mind though because you're starting to deal with the visions better. With your triple threat plan in place you aren't nearly as stressed anymore, well at least until one week before tyrant makes his anticipated appearance.
Three days and three sleepless nights did not do wonders for your mental state and in this moment you don't know if you are going to be able to go through with it or not.
Now you will pay by being fired because of your tardiness but that's the least of your worries. You did everything you could to prepare and even bought electronics with some of your pay to bribe the supply guy. One way or another this is going to happen.
As you're going through your routine today you start thinking maybe you should quit while you're ahead but then you think about what kind of life that would be.
Sneaking in before day shift arrives doesn't help much since as soon as you enter the elevator several others get in with you. It's worse on the bus ride over where at one time you had to stand due to capacity. You try to listen to music but there is no way to block everything out.
A day later you are taken off pizzas and given a position on the chicken ward where the pace is slower and you aren't as stressed out all the time.
The sights and sounds of tube lights and buzzing pole saws fill the airwaves
You are champion an all american alligator delivery agent
Making certain your guile and intelligence overcomes the brutish mutants, you go into your day.
You lay low for a while studying the habits of the various creatures. From what you can tell they split up into small groups of 3-5 and patrol the cave systems. When one group gets too far from the rest they link up with another nearby one to mix up the pathing.
Working for an alligator farm that is slowly going out of business you hear rumors of a secret lab hidden deep underground and start doing volunteer work for extra money. With this in mind and months of patient scouting you set your plan in to motion...
The first part of the plan is to get inside without raising any alarms. The first group of heavily armed mercs is easy enough to evade since they are busy getting drunk in the wild life safari building.
The second group however is a mobile patrol that is actively on the look out.
Hunting down a monster in the swamps of the okeenokee is dangerous in and of itself but you need the cover and the waterleaves help break up your outlines. When one lays down to sleep you creep from rock to rock, vine to vine until you are close enough to kill them with your knife.
The others on patrol soon freak out and run around screaming for reinforcements so you change your plan from covert assassination to dramatic escape!
A desperate man who is going to fail at everything he starts, but for that brief shining moment he is a true champion
Will succeed because of it and continue his life as a hero
You are champion an unparalleled master of subterfuge and escape
Hardships have been faced, and hardships will continue to be faced. It doesn't matter though, you now that you have what it takes to overcome adversity. Sure, years of diligent practice have helped your case but it is your indomitable human spirit that has gotten you this far and will continue too. You finally get to sleep at this point and dream of the far away places you will travel too.
Working for an alligator farm that is slowly going out of business, you realize only 1 guard remains at the front gate. The inner fences have activated sensors so getting through them is no good. Remembering the rotten potato you shoved in your boot yesterday you realize it is the perfect tool for the job.
You sneak up and just as he is turning away you throw the rotten spud against the back of his head. He falls forward and knocking himself out. You slip past and make it to the lab door which is fortunately not locked.
It was a good job of scouting the area that allowed you to avoid any hostile mutants or groups on your journey too the lab. Wanting to keep up the habit you bring out your old maps to see where you should go next.
Once more nature has foiled your plans and your maps have gotten wet during the journey here making them near useless. You wipe off as much water as you can and try to orient yourself.
Checking the date to figure out what is to be done today you instead find that the entry has been scrubbed clean leaving you unsure if this was done on purpose or not.
Watching the time to see if you have awoken ahead of schedule or behind you see that you have got the time right. This makes no sense and out of ideas you head to the door to check the status there.
Something is hastily scribbled onto the sign and it takes you a while to work out what it says:
Looking back at today's date you realize that thought Holding container shutting down in 3...2...1...
Early enough to prevent you being trapped in the past, but late enough that if something had gone wrong for you erasing the writing would leave you none the wiser.
You have escaped from the maze!
Today is a day of clutch collectiong and you grab it all
You grab a nearby mop and bucket and go to work
and your previous ruthless murdering ways pay off when you notice a hidden door
It is too small for the guards to get through but you think you can manage if you squeeze
Will succeed because of it and continue his life as a hero
You are a ruthless killing machine who shows no mercy to his enemies. That being said you treat all people like they are nothing. You need the extra room to live so squeezing into the pipe is not an option for you. Still, you run at the door as hard as you can...
Where is your shadow. You realize you haven't seen him this entire time. It is honestly a little concerning. You hope he didn't do anything stupid like try to stop the riot himself. Maybe you should have ensured that he got out of there safely...
Regardless, you feel it go and land a solid kick to the door which breaks the locking mechanism and send it wide open. Small victory for the cult!
A blast of shampoo to clean yourself off from the blood and any other stains you have got on you from the work you have just done as go back to your private room. Your mind is racing at this point wondering what the hell is going on. You are not the religious type but you do remember a verse from one of these old books that was forced upon you as a child. It felt weird at the time that they were all accepting of your close minded ways but it's good right now.
The arm of the tyrant had been taken by the jaws of the alligator. HIS NAME IS A PUN! Now that that is done, his story is finished and now it is yours to change.
Champion lost himself in heat and suds but you've still got places to be so get back to business.
Laughing at the attempted insult you gear up to get back on the road and finish off this stray thought once and for all.
A not so suble smell emerges from your pits and you quickly find a new shirt. It's amazing what a bit of butchery can do to you. You briefly thank your sun and moon gods that it wasn't both at the same time or you would have had real trouble. Now then where was that, yes that's the one...
That's when you feel something drop onto your shoulder.
You can pay a dollar for the cheapest stuff or splurge for three and a half on the good stuff.
The miltary is still swarming over the city streets but as long as you aren't committing mass genocide or looting everything in sight they have bigger problems to attend to and will leave you alone. This is an advantage since you do not wish to be recognized by any of your fellow doppelgangers if at all possible.
The boss will think you have soft head but it will make the roads safer.
You never carried any of your ill-begotten loot with you so you had better keep a low profile for a little longer.
You vaugely remember talk of some sort of government job listing at the post office that you originally tried to apply for the hero job at. Since you can read and write you figure they could help you dig a little deeper into this conspiracy.
After getting directions from a friendly neighborhood bum since you still aren't exactly sure where anything is in this town yet you set off.
A guard watches your every move from the entrance as they are for everyone at this point probably to make sure you don't steal anything.
What is the point of leaving the house if alcohol is cheap and readily available at corner stores anyway?
There are more than a few jobs you could put your time to but post offices seemed like one of the easiest. Even your pitiful charisma of 2 should be able to get you work there and they need all the employees they can get thanks to crooked computers and overworked staff.
You wander the halls looking for the right department while trying your best not to look threatening...Or shady, piece of cake.
Armored men with guns crowding around while muttering things into walkie-talkies is a familiar sight to you given your recent travels around the city and for once it isn't directed at you so you enjoy the spectacle for a moment before making your way to the desk.
From behind the tall wooden barrier Belinda inspects you with a look of disinterest on her face. Your kind have always looked down on them as nothing more than glorified mail deliverers but today she will be doing just that...
Slowly passing of the time by watching others at work was really getting to her.
"What?!" Her voice sounds a lot like yours probably does your head hurts just hearing it.
"I said what do you want?! I'm busy!!"
Clattering of keys turns to thumping as she violently stabs them in anger.
Bye.
Quickly muffled with a wooshing sound as the door closes behind you. Oh right you didn't tell her what you wanted yet,
Well looks like it's off to plan B then,
Wandering the halls again seems fruitless but for whatever reason a small broom closet catches your eye.
Looking around first to see if anyone is watching you quickly open it up and climb inside. The halls were fairly empty so this should be a safe spot to wait until sunset when they close down for the night.
It is tougher than it looks and sounds silly
What kind of shampoo is it that has a "otomy" at the end anyway? Why in the world do they make this stuff so complicated? You never cared what you washed your hair with before and the old brand was fine for you!
You shake your head to get the bubbles out of your ears. You haven't got all day you know, at this rate you might not make it to work on time...You almost chuckle at the irony and how your boss would react IF you turned up at all.
Passing of time quickly now.
While enjoying your trashy romance novel you realize you can no longer hear the bustle of the city. From the visits to the blood banks and nightly walks about, you know that it is within a few hours of sunrise, generally everyone and their mother is asleep by now.
Thinking back on what has happened today so far you realize you haven't eaten much and are feeling rather hungry.
ctims and general creepiness of some of the female visitors you know you could sneak into the kitchens and help yourself without raising any alarms. Actually, that's not a bad idea. Packing a few supplies from there wouldn't be suspicious at all and you're pretty sure the head chef wouldn't miss a few cuts here and there, he or she has never stashed any food in their desk when you've been 'working' late before...
"Right then,"
Your replacement is doing fine and you should have made it in time for your own as well. You know now that you will have to do something about him. You need more time to yourself,
It takes a hour of sneaking around back ways of the manor to get to the kitchens but once inside you realize just how hungry you've been and begin pulling out everything that looks remotely as food and stacking it into a small pile on the counter.
You tell him with all due respect, that you don't think your replacement will work out and for him to take his time before finding a new one.
"It's happened before and it will happen again so don't stress yourself over it, I'll be back in my office tomorrow."
The voice on the other end of the line is silent for a few seconds as he tries to formulate an argument, then simply replies with
"Alright. It's your funeral."
You smile to yourself, you might get lucky yet.
Working for an alligator farm that is slowly going out of business was never your dream but at least you'll get to enjoy your free time and hopefully that time will be a lot longer than originally expected.
Seeking death in a rough industry is tempting but you know that when the time comes, it will come and there is nothing you can do to stop it, but waiting for it is just plain silly.
It paid well, gave you food on the table and a roof over your head but - like everything else - you realize that it simply was not for you and leaving it is surprisingly easy.
"Well, I'm off to see the world," You announce as you stand in the kitchen loading up a bag with food for your next few days out.
Your mother sighs,
"You don't want to stay and help your brothers with the farm..." It's not really a question.
You are the only person there with a smirk on their face.
"Nope, not my thing," You call back waving, "I'll see you all sometime."
The door closing behind you cuts off any potential response.
Listening to the tyrant tell you the story of the alligator attack is almost exactly how you remember it, the only major difference is that you both exit the STORY proper at a different time.
You've left the house within seconds of hanging up the phone, which due to your rush you end up chewing through the conversation without realizing where you were getting to,
"So he sent him to hospital..." You finish up as your walking partner ends his tale with the customary finger pointing.
use this chance to ask questions about other areas and if you remember anything about them, and do your best to use the information as best you can while not getting distracted from the important aspects of staying alive in your walk to safety...
Moving in out of the slower with maximum speed the two of you make great progress, besides your own skill at avoiding the dead and the zed the number of patches that appear to be unrelated to either side is high, for whatever reason you're passing a number of small communities that have set up safe areas, none of which seem to be attempting contact with one another or opening their gates to strangers.
They even deliver here at times.
Supplying a community with two people in it, let along one of any size must be difficult at best, impossible at worst but the two of you hardly make a dent in the stores they have set aside, even if they are only drinking the weak stuff.
You give your knowledge on dealing with alligators after hearing one of the tales from "Gators" himself.
ght stands out as interesting, it is kinda cool that you managed to at least supply your new friends with a distraction from giant lizard nightmares.
Never get it, some people are unnerved by worms and slimy things but a reptile nearly twice the size of an average car having you for breakfast came straight out its mouth and chasing you on land was the least of your worries, who knows though, you were pretty shaken up at the time.
You make plans with your new companions to go their way for now but will stay in contact and eventually head to meet up with them when both parties are ready.
These rich folk do not know hot it is laying floors for 12 hours today.
thinks one of the workers to another as you walk back through Heaton, You arrive back at "The usual spot" with enough time that brings your walk home well into the next day but you know full well once this batch is set you are going to have a few slower days so no point in rushing.
Tyrant smells of cheap cigars and hard liquor when you return and goes on about some bandits he "accidently" ran into in a secluded area for so long that any normal person would assume it was a heated battle, but you know that it's just his excuse for another game of poker.
The next few days are indeed slower as Tyrant predicted, being confined mainly to The sewers leading into the facility and only leaving them to go grab food.
Arrive to work at the alligator farm on time and attempt to be social with the workers, who give off a similar mindset to the scum you have been living among for months now so it makes things easy.
You've been taking the drops for a while so hopefully the time is nearly right, you try asking the boss if he has known cases of theft recently but he says that due to how low tech their security is they rarely ever have people attempting it, still you chalk it up as a possibility and keep an ear out.
You pasted on the way to work yesterday so can't really do it again today as you would be arriving late so instead you wait until lunchtime when the workers take their deliveries and head out to meet Blinky and Kyle where they wait across the road, "Kyle This is Blinky. I mentioned him to you yesterday." You essentially say as you wave to the very nervous man across the road, not surprising after all he has heard.
Rounding up gators across tile floor of the barn and hand feeding them until it's time to leave, you know tonight is the night.
You head home and say your usual goodbye to tyrant as you leave but as soon as you turn your back he gets a nasty grin on his face and makes a hunch that you won't be returning.
The Facility seems lit brighter than usual as you approach and can hear noise coming from it further confirming your earlier suspicion that they were rushing to get the job finished.
g a message for the janitor after arriving "I may be a while, opening a gastro pub down in the vaults, should keep everyone happy while the boss does some overtime." You add as your excuse should you be questioned.
Its really not that hard sneaking around in the facility as the guards are all indoors drinking and looking out for any vandalism to the stills rather than patrolling as would make sense.
This will be last day at this job and you have yet to access the secured area, Kyle said he had Tinker get him some blueprints of the place and saw a reference to lab 5 so if all goes to plan you might just get inside there tonight.
You run through what food you has on you that would be good to stuff in your sack for a snack while getting around the place.
Even insomnia all the time but i can't stop the yawning.
A bunch of left overs from yesterday makes up your loot sack which is slung over one Shoulder as you keep on the move, checking every so often that the cherry tonic bottle is still in place.
Keeping to the shadows you make your way over Blinky and Kyle who wave you over, "Check it, they got it ready to go."
You place yourself in a relaxed state of mind and after taking a moment to make sure you are Not being watched, you Heave your sack onto the Shuttle Glen and twist the cork off the bottle.
You take a long slow breath in through your nostrils as you watch the liquid rise up the glass, almost 98% alcohol so it should burn good and proper.
Looks tempting 12 inches of steel just begging to taste flesh and slide in between organs.
A couple more guards wander out as you watch the rising liquid finally passing the bottle mouth and on to your hand, quickly you give the cork a twist and drop it in before scanning all around for cameras or security.
You cant be caught now.
Having to get a new job or maybe sell teeth on street corner in front of that Chinese restraunt.
The tyrant would be there screaming and shouting for photo op.
None in sight but that doesn't mean they are not around so you quickly head across the shuttle terrain and into the shadows of the still under construction buildings opposite, Yes Kyle was right they never secured this side at all.
who is floating 6 inches above the ground down there?
Not wasting time you make your way down as fast as you dare and set out to find lab 5 reference on the plans.
You pay no mind to the wrongly placed cannon that you pass or the odd looking machine gun, time is of the essence and you hear the alarm go off up at the facility so know you are on a clock now.
You double check the plan as you move and try one door that is locked, tearing the door off its hinges just to make sure but finding only a room full slugs and specimans, unused by your purposes you close it again.
 can crush bone but risks making too much noise
You pause to collect yourself and listen for rise or fall in the noise from above, there doesn't seem to be any and the door to lab 5 is trivial to find now that you are looking for it.
right, let's get this done.
You heft the wrench into the air and turn to bring it down on the padlock when you feel a tingle run down your spine and pause.
Did anyone else hear that?
Fire alarms blaring but you finish laying beams for the solar panel field above your town then half destroy someones door before you announce the use for it.
It was right on top of you, crunching into the padlock and beyond with blood and flesh erupting everywhere, too late to scream, why did you hesitate?!
The gates of the alligator farm are made out of old shipping containers, held together with welds and strong as anything. Even if someone else had heard it, they would have never made out what it was or where it came from
but you know now that you heard it, the sound of a fresh kill being dragged off to be eaten somewhere safe.
You are an all american alligator delivery agent and just made first blood.
Working for an alligator farm that is slowly going out of business, you've heard all the jokes before.
Currently in your last week as an employee there is no way that news of your strange disappearances from work wouldn't leak to the wrong ears, you quit right after the acid in the waterhole story and they still talked about it months later.
some people just don't know when to stop.
Right now you're waiting till nightfall, hiding out in one of the shacks on stilts that dot this side of the 'farm'.
A flash of light you are certain was a camera going off, signals that the alligator man has completed his errand or whatever mission it was he had, and has retreated back to the subway.
You wait till nightfall properly then head for your truck.
Just down the road is the turn off to Shreveport and a 24 hour dropbox, you have provided them with an updated cell phone picture of yourself, hopefully things have changed enough that this time it will actually be you that gets picked up.
For now laying down sheetrock in a 20 by 20 foot room sounds an awful lot better than hunting alligators and you can let the pros worry about things from here.
You did it!
Dealing with unexploded cluster bombs in Cambodia and escaping strange vampire kidnappers in Transylvania were the easy parts of this job, the killings in Africa and America were necessary but the alligator farm was where it finally ended for you regardless of results.
Eyewitness reports, two drops of blood in a vast ocean of red on a concrete floor, maximum evasive action and still finding a half chewed torso.
quarter chewed if you take into account that only 3 limbs were found.
You are champion!
There is a feel to do it all over again but there are smarter folks than you with enough money to pay for constant training and no scruples or sense of right and wrong so they keep doing it or just find themselves replaced by a new batch of hungry immigrants.
Your pendant their guarantee of safety you suppose.
job done, your free now, fly little ant.
Early enough in the morning to have the streets to yourself, you find an all night laundromat and decide to pass some time while your clothing loads in the machines.
You clean your extra pair of boots, they were so full of sand and grit that you didn't even know you had nails in them till they were cleaned out. Staring at your splayed toes and peeling skin you realize just how long your feet have taken a pounding recently.
Mirror is steamed while you lather up with soap and a stiff brush, two minutes is enough.
It's been a long week and you fall asleep watching the clothes spin dry, waking to find everything dry and freshly laundered.
There is no reason to rush now but you can feel itchy feet already starting to get under your skin.
Cussing and hitting you foot on the curb of the sidewalk you head North beside the line of railcars, content enough to head back to the cabin.
It must be Spring again, the grass is green and the rains have come. The sun overhead is hotter than a blanket and within an hour your sweat soaked shirt is clinging to your back, neck and underarms. you peel it off and fold it into a bag to carry over your shoulder.
You wish the blood to be colored red, not that shades of purple and blue. It does make the bramble scratches stand out though along your bare legs and arms. You wished you had remembered to put some repellant on.
Deciding to shower and go to work with clean undamaged skin was not a practical decision but you're to prideful to go back and apply more repellant now.
You set up camp a few hours into the foothills thinking that maybe you could induce hunger by exercise but your stomach just grumbles and thoughts of food bring only dissatisfaction.
The biggest sin of the shadow of the champion included
This morning you found a new energy and with it some determination to persevere. Even though you are being slowly eaten from within, you can make the most of what time you have left.
There is no need to exert yourself excessively and there is much to learn from books so you settle into a routine of reading and short hunting trips to satisfy your hunger. Months pass in something resembling contentment.
Maybe you are just out of shape, you thought you'd be dead by now but you seem to have misplaced your early enthusiasm for suicide. If anything you feel just a little stronger and your senses are razor sharp now.
You've explored all the local caves and searched out all the easy to reach places for food, You'll have to head further afield soon but there is no great rush as it is easy to hunt human when they are confined to herds and tend to travel in large numbers making them rather dumb.
Then standing around won't get you there any faster so you set off to scout a good route from the city. The quickest route will take you through or close to bandit territory so it probably isn't one you should take but distances are distorted out here so it might only be 30 miles away rather than the 60 it seems.
The first few days you stick to valleys as much as possible and haven't seen another living soul since you passed a dullahan rider going the other way two days ago.
Hunting down a monster in the swamps of the okeenokee is one thing but out here where theres an endless supply of food with no risk of a painful death by snakebite it seems like a waste of your time.
You could head back south east towards the Did lobe and eat people out of house and home for years before having to move on but you cant see what advantage it would give you over just staying in the city and eating untouchables. On the other hand there are very few idiots wandering around in the wilderness.
 are you getting up early in the monring to set traps and sneaking up on every sound or do you force yourself to endure the hunger for the thrill of the hunt?

]
Attack!
You set off early in the morning,sacquite bladder full and bellys nearly as full of meat strips (raw. Who knows what species it came from.) These people have charciarbs but no reason so you set out with determination and a sharp rock. remember that route finding is important so you make a few marker stones.
It was a good job you paotanced as you cross into bandit terriotry soon after and come across a small patrol of 3 men. They don't expect attack from anyone with half a brain so you take the first out immediatley by jumping on him from behind and staing his throat. the other 2 only escape destryolition by ignoring you and fleeing for their lives.
You never are sick and you don't like lying down to sleep so as soon as its dusk you keep moving.
The next batch of travellers are vulchers and you know from bitter experience they are constantly teleporting around the area and they fling poison quills at anything that moves (And a lot that don't) You are going to have to be cautious.
These ones are smart however and one sees you early on and calls for back up.
There is some chit chat at the desk before you see the rest of the crew. there are 6 of them altogether and you wait patiently for nightfall before finding a new roost.
You wake very very early the next morning but the vulchers have already gone again, You swear at them for their suden movements but as you ready to leave the roost you see a woman waiting in the trees for you "They are not so smart after all"
Tyrant responding "i am not paying you for april fools"
Checking the date to figure out what is to be done today, You find its actually the 14th so it cant be a sent from tyrant.
You scream something indecipherable and rage for a bit but eventually calm down enough to think "they fell asleep on nightwatch or something" You think you know who it as well, Galik is the main suspect as he was trying to get out of nightwatch the most.
Little does he know but hes about to feel your wrath!
Pulling on some foot wrappings and arming yourself with a rockhard stick you sneak out of the house and make your way to the camp.
They have 3 watchmen on duty. 1 on the road and 1 either side in the trees and their fires are very close to the branches so if you were paying attention they were already give their positions away.
Checking the time to see if you have awoken early enough you slink towards the closest guard on the road and just as you are about to reach out and tap him he notices you. He feints left but you predict that and swipe your stick right smashing into the back of his head. You keep moving and ducking around the branches to the next guard on that side who has now noticed something is wrong.
Gators bite with powerful jaws and wrestle a bit different than bulls but you manage to slip under his defenses and thwack! right across the back of his head making him grunt with pain then fall silent forever. the one on the right is taking notice and raising an alarm among his fellows but you are upon him like a hawk among pigeons. A quick lash from the stick makes him surronde your legs and you knock him out with 2 quick swipes as he is dazed and trying to stand up.
Looks like you are ten minues late to the start of your shift, well at least you finished all your senterrieving for the day.
You hope they appreciate how you sometimes need to get your reps in and a quick ways to do it. you are no hunter gatherer so the easy option through the trees was within option.
"HEY GUYS SLEEPING BEAUTY WOKE UP!"
There would be a knock a the door from Farhan before you had the chance to get back and he comes trotting over squeeling something in that heavy accent of his
"The great unloving Lord has brought you out of your slumber! But you must have enjoyed yourself with all those berry's around your mouth, even the inside!"
You simply let him run off at the mouth while you walk away thinking about the unconscious guards and grinning to yourself "perhaps I should become a hunter gatherer more often....."
A desperate man who is going to fail at everything he starts, but tries so hard that people can't bring themselves to hate him. He's a drunk but hasn't had a drink in over a month, he's a thief but gives away everything he steals, he's ugly but innumerable women claim he is their lover, he's a failure but the king gives him high honors, what's going on with Farhan?
"they always came back" "they always came back" "they always came back"
Its the same 4 words over and over again but this time you are yelling them at Farhan. After Farhan arrived you ignored him like you do with everyone else and got on with your work but he followed and started jabbering away to you.
Time moves so slow and you are forgeting where you have been and what you have done, people don't like you saying things your old friends said but it was so long ago that they are starting to sound similar.
Then in his flurry of words he mentions a place that you know! He said this city, where you are now at was once ruled under another name hundreds of years ago and the Old man had brought it up many times over dinner, even on his death bed.
The inevitable casualty that happens to men of your age in horrible ways had hit him. You are now the last man standing of your group. This small fact attracts Farhan over to you after yelling.
Farhan knows the pain and can relate "I lost many friends in my time too, it must be fate that has us both here at the end, we must unite to fight against fate together!" Is what he says to you repeatedly while hugging you.
Perhaps there is another option out there for someone like you? "we could run away and forget our names" You had once suggested while drunk but they wouldn't hear of it "we would only be playing into the hands of fate" One of them had said, accepting your role was the main path.
You look upon Farhan with fresh eyes for the first time since he had arrived, he had insisted on staying longer than everyone else did while also changing his mind constantly about leaving.
You hearing the first words of the day from the boss "Farhan is getting on everyone's nerve with indecisiveness. So I'm sending him to the mines"
You look into his pleading eyes and say "i don't care anymore... you can have me."
After all who are you anymore.
Watching the time to see if you have awoken a minute early, you creep up to the bedside of your nearest target.
The 3rd wife of the lord, a beautiful but cruel women who revels in the misery of others and whose imagination for torments is only matched by her lust for power... you will have to move quickly. Ripping the covers off her you discover she is not in the bed.
I wonder why i do this? It cannot be for power, or riches. Maybe its just all the misery they have caused so gleefully that they deserve this horrible death.
Laying down in her sleeper you silently laugh to yourself as you remember her torment of others, she is definitely one of the worst ones. You are about to chuck a rag doused in ether spirits when suddenly she leaps into the bed with her face only a few inches away from yours.
Washing the blood and grime off of you in the bath you cannot believe your luck. You are alive! She did not sense anything!
As you exit the bath a murderous scowl is cast upon your face as power and impunity flood through your veins. Farhan must die. He was not experienced enough to take advantage of your most unlikley escape from the perfidious 3rd wife. Besides, she was cruel, what have you got against her?
Almost nothing other than her beauty speeches are just that.
You point your blood stump finger at him and he falls squirming to the ground, but with the poison, he should be dead soon unlike the 3rd wife you almost killed by using an overdose.
His cries keep the guards busy for a while but they soon dispose of his body and no-one else sees it happen.
Wondering if you should apply or what "good" faction due to how close this all was you decided to wait and see what Farhan did before your next big decision point which would be at most a week away.
You know he would be at least nice to you for saving his life. hanged for attempted murderess!
When the day arrived however you still hadn't quite made up your mind so you decide to watch how everyone else acts.
You brawling with a monster and losing, turns out to be good for you because you avoided the scarred svelk executioner in the winding path that was your horrible week as a miner.
Now a blood stump at the the red hot rage you feel you look about you... what to do, what to do...
The Old man has taken a shine to you for some strange reason and seems quite happy in your company. Also if you killed him then who would clarify all the events for you so you could make an informed decision
Farhan and the beloved wife are both keen on you it would seem, she especially. She seems like the sort who would bear your children and coddle them while they grew strong.
But if you had to choose one to get in the ring with one of those scum ECS thugs, which would it be?
Goliath hides his feelings well. He is a true void man but you get the impression if he hated you he would let you know. A lack of visible emotion doesn't mean he likes you though.
Melcar goes on and on about how proud he is of you and that you are a real asset to him... but an accursed never rewarded in this world does not bode well for your kind.
You sell the american alligator egg and meat raised in the company lab section. Apparently it makes for a very interesting taste and can fetch a high price but nobody had bother to raise them before so hunting down the eggs and hatching them took forever!

That's what your new associate is called, an informant for hire and apparently he works for everyone but sides with no one.
Like working with vicious animals or playing with sharp objects in the dark, it is a risky endeavour that could end your life if you are not careful or quick enough. But it also very profitable if you manage to avoid the many traps your competitors have set for said vicious animal.
You are so close to gaining control of the Elios family territory and quite frankly neither of you really want to share it, but there is just too much blood on the hands of both of you.
Lizards with venom that can make you wish for death but not achieve it, vicious mutant giant bugs that seemed to be impervious to pain (or any sense of danger) and finally a couple of "lost" Forge rangers.116 years old nowYear 198
It could be worse and you certainly have had worse but the war with Elios was one of attrition. You knew he wasn't going to go down without making you pay in blood first and that's what he did.
The sunshines over the cow pasture in front of his mansion. It's just grass, a couple of horses and a sand pit but it makes you feel comfortable.
Slavery is always good for some extra cash, drug trafficking and prostitution rackets are no different. It's just too bad that slavery in it's more common forms is quite banned these days and still covered over by layers of law and regulation. Most "citizens" don't even think they are being slaves if they are using health risks illegal drugs or whores.
The favorite food of the champion includes prime rib, steak, pork chops or anything else from the beef family and he is currently picking his teeth. Your man Jorn isn't with you anymore, he died from disease some years ago. He was a strong man and an excellent bodyguard but prone to enjoying dabbling with chems and mutagenic drugs. You never understood that yourself; enjoying putting foreign substances into your body.
A loud bang that is so familiar by now is heard from across the mansion. The champion walks out on his balcony squinting his eyes against the sun and you soon he see a man fall down from the top of one of the wind turbines. He lets out a sigh and shakes his head before going back inside for a cleanup.
He will not forget being robbed again. And you needn't worry about such things either. Now that you have the entire west coast territory pretty much locked down, you can focus on other matters in a more direct manner.
Heading east seems like the plan now and not only for Slavelords, you've lived long enough in the wasteland and want to conquer virgin territory as it were.
You noticing the type of clothing on what is left of the arm printing machines for one thing. Seems like tanned human leather is all the rage lately and used for more than gun holsters and motor oil bottles. Shirts,pants, dresses and lingerie as well. And all of it coming from the east.
It is known that there is a nation to the east, the "neo-citizens"
Gays are happy you are gone and have combined the city-states of Aden into one single nation with very heavy handed laws.
On top of having their own national guard they even have their own secret police (secret because they infiltrate every aspect of society) And they call you a menace to civilized society.
The funny thing is, you have moved on from being a scourge on humanity to filling the same roll a Sauron did in his day.
Your door broken down and the election Asia said she remembered was coming soon and you assumed you were going to have to defend your turf.
But this? This wasn't on your radar.
Setting up your own video network, designing your own 3d glasses and trying to beam direct signals to people's semisentient personal devices so they could watch the election debates live. It seems like a lot of trouble just for an election.
You noticing the shape of the lock on the gate
You are champion an all american alligator delivery agent!
After burrying the two guards dug up from the local cemetery, you continue on down the road.
And that is when you spot a figure approaching your way. Probably a trader of some sort; they tend to travel in caravans for protection since bandits are common on these roads. The funny thing is, he is coming from the city and not towards it.
You get closer and realize this ain't no trader, this is a wanderer.
Didn't return to MN, must be a pseudonym then
We make our home in glorified catacombs underneath a hospital.
Catacombs...? This just gets better and better. All these wandering mnds from wandering Tel across the continent and winding up here; it is a good thing one of them has started keeping notes, otherwise nobody would believe any of this.
Probably another guard, since you put guards at every important door.
Kidnap victims and brainwashed cultists, each expendable in furtherance of our great and mysterious plan...
Great. Now you've got an entire marching band playing inside your head. This can't be healthy.

Chapter 2C: The Tel Sutton Siblings (A Family Band)
We return to the story exactly where we left off.
From the looks of things, he was beaten up pretty bad by someone...or something. Last time someone got the best of you like this it was the gas cloud out near Industry and that didn't turn out too well for our side. Whoever did this to Swifty might be around too so you are going to be cautious about this.
Bubba went out jogging one day not too long ago and hasn't returned, you hope he isn't the one you're stepping over here.
"Swifty?" you call out quietly. You aren't sure he is alive but might as well make sure if you are going to move him.
"Yeah..." a very weak voice answers back. You find him lying in a pile of trash next to a broken down freak show wagon.
You work on a an alligator far in a swamp just outside of town and there ain't no alligators in New York City...so who puts on hicks for...
Swifty is a bloody mess. He was beaten to a pulp and then some. Amidst the bleeding cuts you see an unnatural twist of flesh where his left eye should be. What horror or foul plans did his eye see before they took it? You can't imagine the pain he is feeling, but right now you need to focus on getting out of here alive.
A butcher knife left on a table in the swamp room

Severed human ear on a platinum chain, an apparent gift from your bride to you on your wedding night. After all, true love means never having to say you're sorry...right?
On second thought, get back in the game. It's time to stop reminiscing about old times and start concentrating on surviving the fix you are in right now!
The finger that used to point at you is no longer attached and is instead currently blocking a shot to the chest. Whether you have an extra second or not really won't make that much of a difference in the scheme of things since you doubt if they missed at such close range. But, if you're trying to be stealthy then every little bit helps and so you try to dive behind some boxes just before several gunshots bring the inventory records you were looking at a year ago ...to an end.
Clawhammer beats to play but you ain't quite fast enough...
The Gheight overpowers all its foes with massive blows from one of the largest weapons seen on the battlefield, easily fitting into the category of oversized two-handed swords. Utilizing an initial downward strike to assist in catching a foe off balance and bring them to their knees, the follow through is ruthless...
You had some success last year interrogating an art student that was caught painting a rival gang's graffiti on a warehouse wall.
The thoughts you own flow like bubbles down the pipe and pop before they are seen...
"Well, ain't you a couple of dumb little shits," Mallot scoffs as the last reverberation of his previous statement is felt. Claw and Fang fit the part well with their snarls and snorts, but you at least thought you would be allowed to speak before being cut down like wheat.
"miserable...life" is all you utter as a last testament of your thoughts before the inevetible:
You can't believe they killed you over something as petty as a stencil on a wall! They will never get away with it, but at least you took one of them with you. That's what they'll read when they see you lying here with Clawhammer drowning in his own blood. Let them figure that bit out. You lean back and let death embrace you like an old lover.
Horny gay men are open to criticism, but I trust you won't jump into the story and neuter them. Let the chips fall where they may, that is what I have always believed in.
Nice update to the website! Six badges is a lot! Question: how do you get the "I'm so awesome" badge? :)
I read and favorite all your stories from your first post onsrteetpimp. Thanks for the entertainment!
Time to get paid and go home, kiddies!
Thanks Fableblossom, I really appreciate your kind words.
Thanks for the story and thanks to the mods for working to keep it on the front page so long.
Moving back and forth is life and death, as the blur of movement that you are, the rifle ball just clip your hip and continues on to slam into the stable corner where it finishes the job your dart started. A cavalry sword lying nearby is dropped by a raider as he clutches a bloody hand and looks on in horror at his two dead buddies.
It's going to be one of those days...
Today is a day of clutch collectiong and acquisitions. As a group of six heavily armed riders thunder down the trail leading into Three Roses territory, orders ring out about searching the bodies and taking any goods of value found there.
The last rays of the setting sun leave your party in a dusty pink glow as you enter the Canyon district. Flatland certainly doesn't have anything like this shithole, with it's high rocky walls surrounding dozens of little house entrances and a wide variety of people coming and going.
Still slice through flesh easily.
You noticing the color of the pipe in your hand brings you back to the business at hand.
Once again you have put your ruthless disposition and cold calculated approach toward your profession, and once again you have benefited from it. As you make your way through the streets of Canyon you count your take for the night. Your blade-like jagged knife has acquired and extra edge from being used to cut the throat of a merchant who tried to resist being relieved of his wallet.
Although it's basically rubbing alcohol with a hint of antiseptic, the Dancer's perfume bottles still sell for a pretty coin to the right people. Just Jake got off two perfect shots with his pistol and you palmed three gold rings off of two smugglers as you were leaving their bodies in an alley.
That' divides the take six ways, more than enough profit to spend luxuriously for awhile or save toward building up the bar.
It is time for some more excitement out there in the world, so hang around here and it will be more of the same thing, forever.
Will you stay in the bar...
Or return to adventuring?
Getting faster and faster heart palpitations and blood pressure just from thinking about it, hope when the moment comes, you get over it and jump like a sonofabitch. Lechery and the worldly desires all lead to pain and death anyway, might as well take some pleasures in this life before considering the next right?
Eating pepperoni pizza while watching tv on your day off from working is one thing. Basically, you have a stretching routine that involves sinews and muscles but not a lot of heavy stretching to cause micro tears while allowing the most amount of health benefit for each exercise.
Suddenly the opening theme cutscene to Zombie Massacre comes on your little 13" tv and you mouth the words along with the narrator.
Thinking about everyday things during your 10 minute shower, you begin to lather the shampoo into your scalp and froth it into a lather.
30 minutes before going on shift, you lie down on the bed with a bag of organic chips and hold up your polotics magazine with 2d cardboard glasses and read an article about the upcoming elections while trying to ignore what you've become.

Every time you get your blood drawn as part of a medical screening, the phlebotomist always says in a chipper voice something along the lines of "Now I KNOW that hurt", followed by her tone becoming more deadpan as she looks at the blood that just got on the tube, "But you can take comfort in knowing you're helping science"
Creative writing classes usually start off with writing poems or other untimed writing to get you in the mood of what it's like to write. Then, in other classes you have time constraints where you are forced to edit and improve something, but this is just freestyle imaginative writing that has no limits and no rules and no laws and just see what comes out.
Tyrant looks as if he does not believe what just transpired between the two of you by the book and code of honor that you all went by. The ridiculous reality that you just won this fight amazes him as much as it does you. Yet, there you are, walking back along with your saviors from certain death.
You are tired of this dead end job and just going through routines and motions to get by. Stuck in a rut as the saying goes and just going through this life like a zombie, forever searching for better pastures but never finding anything.
Slowly the gnawing hunger fades and your mind feels clearer as your senses come back. The roars and noises of other people trapped in their broken shells cuts out immediately and everything becomes very quiet.
Now you will pay by being fired from your job at the local gas station after beating up a customer, but in that brief moment the choice was certainly worth it.
The world stops moving forward and everything comes to a grinding halt. At least one of you has decided not to just accept this horrible hand that fate has dealt and that you will NOT go quietly...
Stopping for a moment to tilt your head left and right to pop your neck, you continue "strutting"
Watching televsion all day and living off of the government is not a life. It is barely being alive. Every day my only meaningful relationship is with my tomato plants on my fire escape that I have to water every day. My dreams are plagued by the memories of my dead wife and the times when everything in life made sense. Everyday I watch as young people like yourself go walking down the street, laughing and enjoying everything. Everything in my life has become humdrum, like a machine running on autopilot.
Tyrant will not be so happy when we go to his jungle.
He will finally see that he has been living a half life as well. First I will take away everything from him. Then he will meekly try to beg for mercy. Then I will take away his life.
You have ceased your endless journey through life and have decided that now is the time to break free of your chains and live. So far things are going quite well. These new creatures you've met certainly seem like a friendly sort.
Easy enough
Sneaking in before day shift arrives to unlock the building and seeing who is in which cell is easy enough. There are only five guards including Tyrant and they all seem like the type that drink a lot on their lunch break. Your powers will be more than a match for any of them.
One even has a set schedule where he walks to a local deli every day at noon, buys a ham sandwich, then walks along some small local parks before returning.
You won't leave your body lying around for Tyrant to see of course, but instead project it out of your cell and traveling upward. After walking a mile or two you reach your destination and sneak in through an open window. No alarm has been raised and you have an entire day to scout the lay out of the building including where the security room is located as well as where the backup power supply is kept.

You have to go feed.

You brawling with a monster and losing.
Hunting down a monster in the swamps of the okeenokee is a desperate man's task. 
There are a host of normal natural dangers, 
and very real snares of many an expeditionary company, 
which prowls these swamps with musket and cutlass, 
always seeking to nab the monstrous beasts that lie under the surface of Okeenokee. 
Though the largest concentrations lie beneath the waters of this swamp, 
there are also half-human amphibious creatures above the water as well.
Scrounging for a weapon to attack the monster with, 
you realize you have no fire arms. 
A musket would be nice right about now. 
You wonder if you can skewer it before it catches you. 
You consider the material of which the boat you are in is made of. 
It isn't a strong craft meant to terrorize the water, 
but it's enough to hold weight, 
perhaps it can act as a protective shield from the creature as you push it forward.
lucky enough to have an ARROW left.
Posing with the defeated monster at your feat, 
you look around to make sure clhat you are correct about your surroundings. 
You are starting to get a feeling of sureness about the fact that you have been here before by the familiarity otit. 
It is almost 6 in the morning so you decide to follow the bank until you come across a familiar trail.
A little more than an hour later, 
you find Rose Creek Camp Ground just where you remembered it.
Chasing down a wounded monster and surviving an attack in the process is quite a thrill even though you have experienced death before.
Dancing out of the pathway of a powerful monster tail, 
you strike it clean in the eye when it makes a lunge at you.
You face the monster again and kill it from whence it came.
Seems like you're getting good at this video game training after all.
Screaming from the ripping of your flesh from the monster teeth makes you lose yourself 
in the thick fog of searing pain throughout your entire body. 
The worst thing still, is the thought that this could all happen again 
as you may have to enter this world many more times in preparation for the real thing. 
Just as your body starts to fill with unbearable anguish, 
and darkness creeps in on your sight, 
The Camerado from before comes out of his tent at Rose Creek Camp Ground 
and aids you quickly to his place of residence.
Challenging a monster with such little experience 
for the first time is rather reckless. 
You didn't even know if you could die in here, 
but luckily a creature won't live long enough to tell tales if it succeeds in a killing blow.
Perhaps YOU won't live to tell and complete your mission if luck isn't by your side during these trials.
Avoiding the sharp bite of a monster is still preferable to standing and fighting in your line of thinking, 
and you wonder whether the horrors of war have melted away your common sense.
You dwell on these thoughts as you lie down to take a short rest from the night's activities, 
thinking this experience is far from over.
Creating space between you and the monster
Expecting the beast to run away if you can muster a solid hit, you find the beast is relentless. It doesn't show signs of recoil and continues approaching to strike.
You run a circle around the creature in an attempt to keep distance and prevent it from getting a direct hit. It darts its head trying to catch a bite until its finally lunging forward with its prey in its mouth.
The creature shakes its head wildly and deposits you on the ground in a loud thud.
Hearing the crashing of a giant monster through the cypress swamp, you struggle to get up and continue running.
Trying to roll and dodge another bite from the creature is all your body can muster as you slowly start getting blinded and losing a sense of direction in this green hell. You fumble around looking for something but unless you reach the waterway your chances are slim.
You wonder whether you could find something in the murky waters to kill it since its singular eye gives it poor vision.
Feeding the monster you right arm to keep from being eaten alive sounds lame compared to slaying it yourself.
Shadowing a monster that has not noticed your presence as of yet
Running away from the more powerful monster isn't wise but at least you won't be eaten alive. The beast couldn't even see you!
You hide behind the body of the other monster, hoping that the main course of what appears to be a lizard won't notice your scent. You must be willing to risk death if you are to survive.
Stalking a monster that has not noticed your presence as of yet
Running away from this creature sounds dangerous but at least you will live to fight another day. It couldn't even see you!
You hide in the bushes and wait until the giant lizard wizzes past you, fleeing the scene of its dinner date.
If only you could be so lucky...
You draw your dagger, keeping a distance of about 15 feet from the beast, cautiously approaching it as it feeds on its prey.
Facing amonster
Brawling with a monster and losing
Scrounging for a weapon to attack the monster, you approach closer and closer until you're within striking distance of the beast. It continues feeding on its prey with its head down.
Posing with the defeated monster at your feat, you attempt to drive your dagger into one of its soft body parts. But as soon as you raise your arm higher to get the appropriate force in the stab, you feel a sharp pain go through your skull before feeling a crushing pain through all of your bones.
The beast crunches you up like a taco shell and swallows you whole, licking its bloody chops waiting for its next meal to come around again.

Challenging a monster that is much more powerful than you
Awakening a monster from its meal feels your warm blood filling the creature's belly with your flesh slowly regenerating as it lays you upon its back. You've shown no resistance to its powerful attacks and have only weakened the creature slightly with your unusually acidic blood.
Unsurprisingly, it feeds upon you for a fourth time before making sure you won't be trouble again.

They claim that Paranormal Preservation are wimps for refusing to hunt werewolves in their home territory.

You look closer. The entire thing consists of scrambled words and definitions, with the exception of the last line.
"smoking", "vampire", "Dylant", "be" and a bunch of others are circled.

However, that's not what interests you. It's the bolded word that catches your attention.
"Faced", you whisper. It has to be the password.
The scrambled letters remain scrambled, however. You've tried every combination of words you can think of. "Faced", "Vampire", "Molester", "FUCKING", nothing works.

It's not working. You give up, and try to sleep. Maybe you'll think of something tomorrow...
As you close your eyes, a deafening crash comes from somewhere. You shriek, finding yourself instinctively shrinking in your chair. After a few seconds, another crash comes, sounding closer than the last one...

You turn off the computer and run out of your room.
contemplating traveling west, you will find that ive walled off the way with furever bricks. Studying my maziness, i notice thee become a masterbuilder of confusion.
A brick wall has been erected across the hallway. You bang your head against it several times in rage... And then suffer a momentary brainfart as you remember what college students are known for. You go back inside, turn on the compy, and begin to hack into the district's power grid.
screaming barrage of infiltrator manaspheres, you strike gold. The brick wall disappears, revealing a small corridor. Following it further, you find yourself inside a roughly-hewn cavern with organic purple bricks making up the walls. It glows with an otherworldly light.
A hunched beast stirs in the center of the room. It has smooth, pale yellow skin and angular limbs.
dropping erpentrope poison into the cave's ripples, it does nothing. Allitems arc slain by gates of electricity. You laugh, because that was so funny you don't know why and how.

You awake to a field of blue, unable to move so much as an inch. You search desperately for what's holding you down, only to realize that there is nothing. You can't feel anything except the warm glow just beneath your skin. You stand up, finding yourself atop a platform hovering in a starry sky. A cackling sort of laughter chills you to the bone...

> You suffocating heart-sickening valley.
Frightful shadows lurk, sinister and serpentine. Faint echoes of the incessant ticking of a clock that measures the seconds of your life.
Then you hear that terrible laughter once more...
You rush to the edge of the platform, gazing in horror at what lies below: A vast void, infinite in size. Countless winged serpents writhe below, a scourge that has no place among the earth and skies...

> You climbing american alligators.
Annh hngaahBurble hack gaspFifteen feet long and three tons of meat and bone and teeth and rage, they fly through the cavern towards you with astonishing speed.
You duck your head, trying not to look like food, but you can feel the creature's bloodlust deep in your soul.You slowly step back, then rush towards the next staircase. Predictably, the alligator beast lunges towards you. Desperately, you sprint up the stairs.

> You mysterious image-gathering.
Mostly, you are obsessed with mysterious things of nature, particularly the more macabre parts. You draw these images onto paper, re-creating them in pencil, water colours, paints... Anything which has any degree of ability to show these glimpses into another world.
Still, there is one thing that has caught your attention far above all others. It stares at you from the wall across the room.

> You pusspack emptying grimy uncompromising doorbell.
You stand at the bottom of a short stairway. A gloomy red light glares softly off the walls from somewhere beyond, casting angular shadows. Still, it is not particularly bright; whomever chose the lighting had a decidedly somber mood. The air is stale, faintly scented by pine needles and camphor.A large, darkened room sits before you. Above the door frame sits a sign reading "Slumber Rooms."

> You astryl Wydle accepting thinking plotting weirdos.
The Slumber Rooms are split into small kennels, each with enough room for a grubby mattress to be placed. A pillow sits on top of each of them, odd considering that no one uses pillows when sleeping outdoors. Just beside the stairs is the head of a giant snake made of sheets and a few other spare blankets, which lies unused.
The walls are barren, not a single photo to be seen anywhere.

> You astryl smiling towards groaningm pathways.
The hallway leads only to forking paths. Moving quickly through the darkness, three brightly lit doorways sit at the end of branching hallways, identical to the one you are in now. One door is blue, glowing with an unnatural light. One door is green, pulsing softly. One door is red, casting a sinister crimson light across the walls.

> You endeavouring to emerge through blue Astyrl.
You do not see a blue Astryl here.
Unsettled, you scan the hallway for other options.
The door to the left is painted in large, dark block letters: DERT. The door to the right is more normal, but a sign warns people to take a Number and wait quietly. Finally, the door at the very end of the hallway says "Exit" on it in plain Roman letters.

> You astryl undressing in front of authorities planning token migration.
You awake in the middle of the night, drowsily turning over. It was just a nightmare. You're fine, there's nothing to worry about. You're tucked up in bed, wearing warm pyjamas. Mommy and Daddy lie asleep in their bed beside you. Outside, sirens wail briefly, but they're far away.

> You simo flowing sirens into the Okeenokee Swamp where.
Forest surrounded by mysterious, deadly swamps are so common in fiction that it takes to an hour of googling pictures before you're able to name your particular swamp: the Okeenokee. The Okeenokee Swamps cover between 500 and 1000 square miles of land in southern Georgia.

> You juicy curves camping among curiously expensive.
The Okeefenokee Swamp Park is a haven for all those interested in exploring the beautiful, deadly swamps without getting deadly themselves. There's a boardwalk winding throughout the park, allowing tourists to easily and safely travel through the park's many sights.
Fees apply.

> You wood trestles beach growing with.
After a short walk, you come across a large boardwalk running through the forest. The trees look old and weather-beaten, with bursts of pink and purple flowering out from the trunks. The most common tree is strangely similar to the shady Mimosa trees of Louisianan fame.
Either side of the two foot walkway is filled with mud, but there's no chance of that closing in no matter how far you stand from the center...

> You simo disentangle in mud.
You gently release, thin branches snaking into the sticky mud and lifting you into the air. As you hang far above the ground, you turn your head to look at the park around you. It's surrounded by evenly spaced pines, tall and evergreen. People wander the boardwalk in the orange surveyor's uniform, while little red arrows painted on posts ensure that no one gets lost.

> You noticing Greasy Gallon.
Twenty feet away from the trees a rusty service cart sits alone, heaving under the weight of a heavy-set woman. She wears the traditional garb of all walkway attendants: orange cotton short shorts and an oversized yellow button-up shirt. Her short brown hair stands on end.
The words "Slimy's Swamp Safari" are written in dripping, watery letters across the back of her shirt.

> You speaking with Greasy Galloon.
"What's this place?"
"This here's the Swamp Safari! My family's run this here business for six generations now."
"What is it?"
"We take people through the swamp, within eyeshot of floating islands, hostile fauna, and nothing but nature!"
She opens a metal box on the side of her cart, pulling out a battered sign.

> You looking at the finger of Greasy Galloon as she points into a design which contains unentertaining trainspotting.
She holds the sign behind her back, and points to one of the pictures: A happy gorilla drinking from a muddy pool.
"We also take people on safari through the marsh. We got all kinds of exciting animals that you can look at and take photographs of while we tell you about 'em and such!" She smiles proudly.
"Interesting." You reply, utterly unimpressed. "I'll have twenty pounds of persimmons for the road, if you please..."

> You listening to Greasy Galloon listing the various types of bird watching available during the Swamp Safari.


> You wonder about the third option which.
The woman takes a ring of keys out of the pocket of her ugly yellow robe and unlocks a door, which squeaks open. She beckons for the four of you to follow her as she leads you inside the room and turns on the light.

> You studying artwork on walls.
On the walls of what turns out to be a small gift shop are four very basic oil paintings of swamp scenes. There's one depicting a large group of 'Cajuns' dancing in a circle around a guy with a guitar, one of alligators swimming among the reeds of the swamp, one which appears to show a 'fairy' seen from behind, and finally one of the odd tiled roof of an old shack protruding up from th long grass.

> You toying with an idea to purchase a painting.
You wonder which of the paintings is worth taking home. None of them are particularly good, but some are always more appealing than others.

> You focusing closer on the large group of dancing 'Cajuns'.
The painting is depicting the kind of scene for which these people have become almost legendary: A group of young people dancing around a musician playing a Cajun accordion. One of the younger men in the crowd has just thrown his head back in order to seize the hand of a smiling young lady dressed in a flowing blue dress, and whirl her around him, exchanging joyful glances. The musician plays on, unperturbed.

> You inspecting detail of flowing blue dress.
The style of the girl's dress tells you that it's probably not a modern painting, and is probably meant to depict life before the Big Heads took over. It's very well-painted, especially in the way it captures the light shining almost magically off the girl's flowing blue skirt as she twirls.
It's also apparent that David Menlo agrees with your assessment that this is definitely the best painting.

> You figuring out what David Menlo is doing right now.
You can easily guess what he's doing right now. He's probably sitting in his comfortable recliner at his home in New York, perhaps sipping a glass of some alcoholic beverage, the way he usually does. He's definitely feeling pleased with himself; putting on this exhibit was a risk for him, but it looks like everything turned out fine after all.

> You discovering the name the current art show.
Unsurprisingly, "David Menlo's Jub Jub Birdwatching Portfolio" sounds like a terrible idea for an art exhibit.
David Menlo is a name you haven't heard in a while. You sort of followed his career since the two of you were graduate students together at Harvard, but he kind of dropped off the map after he dropped out of graduate school.

> You remembering the reason for the difficult and laborious exit.
Laborious doesn't even begin to describe what the hell you just had to go through in order to get this hideous painting.
But it was all worth it, because now you can take this stupid painting home and it will no longer be on your mind, and like all bad memories eventually fade from your mind all together, or at least you hope it works that way.

> You streaming the adventure of Simo Beeing chasing the Cajun painting.
The link is provided here.
This concludes the first 'episode' of David Menlo- The Cajun Painting.

> You hunting the plot line of the first episode.
Strong introductory post. The characters seem like they have potential, and the world you've painted is intriguing. I'm not entirely caught up on what has come before this (I've only read 2 pages of what you've written of this story), so maybe that is why certain important characters and details aren't apparent to me as they might be to a reader who had been with you since the beginning. Obviously there are deeper reasons for New York being the way it is than a simple virus.

> You crossing off all the reasons for leaving New York.
Every reason you can think of for leaving New York City are either non-starters or represent consequences that are worse than staying in the affected area. Plus, at this point, attempting to leave is probably more dangerous than staying put, so you figure you'll do what most other folks in New York will do: Take your chances and hunker down.
You remind yourself to start keeping a few extra cans of food on hand in the apartment.

> You cleaning empty can of Salamander breakfast.
You spend the next several hours erasing your digital footprint. On the computer, you browse exclusively using Incognito mode and clear out your history and cache every time (although due to the anonymity of the Internet it's not like anyone is going to find anything that pinpoints you to your identity). You delete your Facebook account, along with any other accounts you may have had. Finally, you take all the information off of your social security card (name, DOB, etc.

> You deleting link to moaning hot flesh.
Now that you're all set to go off-grid, you put on the bulky jacket you keep in your closet just for this occasion. You take a few moments to enjoy one of your favorite movies, The Matrix trilogy , because who knows if you'll ever have the opportunity to do so again (and because it's awesome). And then, around noon, you go buy a large bundle of wooden matches and ten cans of tuna fish.

> You paying the cost of the supplies.
You stop at some skuzzy convenience store (convenience stores tend to populate the less desirable parts of any city, with the attendant increase in crime) and pick up your supplies. You feel nervous wearing your entire savings on your person, but need outweighs caution and you don't want to risk going to a different store.
As soon as you walk through the door, you're greeted by the smell of old bacon, which permeates every supermarket in the city.

> You considering how the the pork spurt senses are similar to the smell of the Greasy Galloon apartment.
The cashier at the counter is watching a small TV with his feet up.
"Hey buddy," you say, feeling slightly nervous about the fact that he's watching the sheriff's most wanted, "could you turn that down?"
"Huh? Oh yeah," the bored man responds, looking as if he's thoroughly disgusted by something. He turns down the TV and addresses you in an annoyed tone.
"What can I get for you today?

> You thinking about your needs.
You think about what you need.
"Give me a pack of Salem Menthols and a lighter."
The man flipping through the TV channels briefly pauses on a programme showing two women pleasuring one another's sexual organs. You avert your eyes - you've never been comfortable with these types of broadcasts, which the Greasy Galloon's cable companies are notorious for. Perhaps someone hacked into the network at the coffee shop? The pixelation makes it hard to identify.

> You becoming thankful with a witnessing of only a hundred pink pixels.
"You want something else?" says the attendant in a bored tone. "A rolling paper for your cigarette?"
"No, I'm good, thanks," you say, snatching my change and leaving the store.
Outside of the Greasy Galloon apartment isn't much better - although today there are two skin-crawlers making out on the pavement instead of four. You give them a wide berth as you approach the entrance to your building.

> You classifying the kissing skin-crawlers.
"Why do I feel guilty for avoiding those two?" you ponder, as you descend in the entryway of your apartment building.
The apartment building lobby is full of rubbish: a discarded sofas soaked with foul liquid, walls speckled with v stains and a rank smell of sewage pervading the air.

> You laughing that the air lost its bacon smell.
You dial the combination to your lock and rifle through your mail while fishing out your set of keys. A Netflix DVD, offers for credit cards you don't need, update from your phone company and another, scented envelope divine: Love Letters!
Well, well. Someone is in lvoe. You rip open the envelope and start reading:
Virgil,
I hope you llike this touching short story I thought about you!

> You reading short story.
The features of Mr. White were very sharp and thin, almost like a corpse. Unlike other men you had seen the expression in his eyes never changed from the blank look, as ifhe were sleepwalking all the time. It was well known that his wife had divorced him years ago on grounds ofimpotency, and linked closely to that his lack of any interesting in anything at all, and the story he told you about losing his front teeth.
traveling to Lixie Dixie, the land of milk and chocolate. You know little about this place but what you've heard from your British boss, that is that the people there seem to be blonde and blue-eyed descendants of the old Germanic tribes ofEurope. They are a bit like the Haidas in that they refer to themselves asschweine, pigs, but theirs is not a mere statement of identity, but a declaration ofpurity, being the last surviving group ofpigs left on the planet after the great baptism of fire.

A revolutionary force that fades as quickly as it appears, like a shooting star burning itself out. You smile at their call to arms upon realizing how crazy they all are.
Taking those things that make you, you... Like the Zenith Radio building. A high place, a good place for personal reflection...
You are reflecting on the high place. Feeling the money in your pocket... The record... It is better to be dead than red?
What now?
That's a Zen koan for you. The beginning of wisdom is unanswered questions. Start asking them, start writing.
You write first sentence.
A low rumbling wakes you around midnight. Like a tram coming to a terminal, or cannons in the distance.
Do you hear what I hear? There's someone at the door.
(Ending: Jenkins sbors amot)
Still, you wonder what happened...
You imagine what happened.
You imagine hearing the door open somewhere else in the apartment It could be Rick, coming home from the firehouse. Or it could be... The Harlem Hatfields, come to steal your grandmother's radio . You've heard enough stories to know that they would do such a thing. You reach for the first weapon you can think of --your racket ball trophy from last year.
You bust into the room prepared for anything. And what do you see Rick sleeping peacefully.
You imagining something wonderful changing the world. Time to get some sleep.
Even though you know better, the ending still seems to surprise you. Despite yourself, it makes you laugh.
You laying down on alligator sheets. do you fall asleep or try to pull yourself out of this living Corwmpth?
weight on your chest. Turning around you see a little girl, no older than seven with coal black hair tinged with white , sitting on top of you pressing tins hollow out with a pained look on her face. She quickly turns to see you and gives you a once over before turning back around.
You screaming.
Trying to get inside the tiny cupboard your grandmother keeps her kitchen towels in you scream out-- Help! I'm being attacked by a ghost!
Screamation is supposed to ward off evil spirits but this doesn't work in the slightest. Maybe because there aren't any such thing...
You pull out of another failed Scw conversion and find that not only are you unable to sleep but you're even shaking for some reason. Why am I shwcwing?
You looking at the trembling of my left hand. It seems out of place. Maybe I'm cold?
Looking around you find yourself in your bed, which is reasonable. The current temperature outside is only a little chilly sitting at 55 degrees. Why am I still cold though? 60 degrees, maybe the air conditioner needs to be turned up a bit.
With those thoughts in mind you pull off your considerately placed blanket and turn towards your bedside table to reach for the remote....
You feeling warmer. I shouldn't get too cold if I adjust the air conditioner.
You feeling hot. I should really turn the air conditioner.
Why on earth am I hot?
Eric 707 standing next to you, screaming at you about your mistake. You upset at yourself, wondering what happened to you and what is happening to the world. Soon there is yelling and violent threats from Rick and confusion inside your head as you struggle to think clearly.
The room is flooded with emergency vehicles of all kinds outside with their sirens blazing bright.
You are feeling like you are on fire.
I NEED TO TURN DOWN THE AIR CONDITIONER!
You staying where you are. No use in getting complacent from here. Looks like the announcements were correct.
You reading announcement. Time 10:07 PM
An increase in spine-chilling screams fill the town as many have gotten to experience first hand what you just did. The emergency vehicles are all in response to... whatever this event is. Maybe you could just stay in your apartment and wait until tomorrow. Wouldn't it be nice to sleep on such a luxuriously soft bed? Could you really pamper yourself when so many around you are in danger?
You triggering the event. Time 10:08 PM
You begin to hear the screams outside of your window, and it sounds agonizing. The people in the apartments next to you are running out of their balconies screaming for help and being taunted by this new terror. It looks like only one person can see these creatures, everyone else just think they're loony. You're really regretting your decision now, there's no way you could get to safety without exposing yourself now.
You closing the portal opening releasing nude muscular men with alligator skulls for heads. Time unknown
The announcement is right. There is no way of telling how long it will take for them to calm down. The creatures look like they were ripped straight out of Mayan culture, which would make sense given the location and date, but why angels? There's no answer you could think of that makes sense. No matter what you do you're sure your night won't be pleasant. At least not as pleasant as it could've been had you stayed in.
You attacking closest creature. Time unknown
You knew it wasn't going to be easy, but you didn't think it would be impossible. The alligator man manages to grab your wrist and break it with ease, forcing you to drop your knife. Instantly the other three creatures pounce on you, breaking your other arm, both legs, and shattering your ribs. All while never giving you a single chance to escape, even after you're beaten into submission.

Summer begins to study the different reports, looking for anything that might stand out. A police cruiser pulling into the driveway causes her to freeze up temporarily.
Parked in front of her house is a state-issued car with a uniformed officer patiently waiting for you to acknowledge him.
In the meantime, you've taken cover behind several rows of seats and have tried to move as far from the opening of aisle
It was always fun trying to experience these 16-bit systems from an older time period.
Wording in these games tend to be pretty random, several of the words in this list do not mean what the computer thinks they mean.

Playing around with the misnomered CRIM-05, you turn some of the text blue for a few moments before the screen cuts to static.
There's nothing much going on, just a few rows of endless shelved computers running different programs automatically in a silent facility protected by a small network of cameras and guards.
Almost about to sign off and go to bed, you notice something a little odd on one computer terminal.
Discovering Alligator hide...
AN EXCITING DISCOVERY IN ALLIGATOR INFESTED WETLANDS
Sweeeet. Smells like a Teenage (godless liberal) terrorism manual designed to rot the minds of our nation's youth.
In the Security Office.

"This is getting nowhere!"
While running for cover as usual, you notice that some of the blue words have disappeared upon scrolling up. Some tab-selection fun later, line 2080 reads "north vs. south". Hmm...vague, but something to go on.
Contacting Confederate Art Army, you learn that the traitorous OscarMeyr is most likely located in the war-torn south. Informed with this knowledge, management deems it unnecessary to alert the Capitol Building or local law enforcements before dispatching a squad of highly skilled CARD officers to commence Operation: Stop OscarMeyr. Once the development team gained access to the master database, you were made aware that OscarMeyr has consistently been spotted in Sector G42 of the server fields.

It appears that OscarMeyr is lightly clad in clothing and is wet: Could it be that he fell into one of the drainage ducts?

The figure charges into the rows of computers and frantically looks around. Due to your excellent hiding spot, it is now or never that you must choose to strike or remain hidden...

He'll be a strong man
Oh, honey!

He'll eat nutritious, high protein
And swallow raw eggs
Try to build up his shoulders
His chest, arms, and legs
Such an effort
If he only knew of my plan
In just seven days

I can make you a man

He'll do press-ups and chin-ups
Do the snatch, clean, and jerk
He thinks dynamic tension
Must be hard work
Such strenuous living
I just don't understand

Oh, baby
I can make you a man

The two men stood close to the white truck with the black tail gate. 
Water dripped off the bumper from the recently cleaned chaps from the gator egg hunt. 
"Pound for pound, which one is stronger an poled Hereford bull or an american alligator," 
the younger bald man asked the older bald man who answers, 
"It is not a contest, the gator.
The older man went on to describe why he felt this way by mentioning each creatures' 
bite force, other abilities, and natural defenses.


Many players want to engage enemies using only magic. Picking up a gun feels almost
like cheating to them, especially when faced with high-quality security weapons. This
can be frustrating for mercenaries and lifesprenuers who need to fire armor-piercing
bullets or use explosive weaponry when required. How do you keep these players
happy?
Being. Laughing. Hunting. Sleeping.
Thinking. Loving. Telling.
Wishing. Working. Wondering.
One of the best ways is through granting an instinctive reaction to danger. Non-humans and
some high-end corp security may have armor, so you'll want to provide firepower that can
both match and bypass this personal protection.
This is all in addition to security measures designed to keep metahumans (orks, trolls,
gargoyles, etc) under control.
You stand next to a man with a chiseled face broing out next to a white truck. You ask, "Pound for pound which is stronger and Polled Hereford Herford or an American Alligator?"
"I didn't know they had gators in this county."
"They don't." You pull off the gag and hand him the clipboard.
He looks shocked. "You drugged me! Why would you do that, Elios?"
"Contracts can be extremely dull. You looked like you could use a laugh. That's why I sent Fire to pick you up."
He shakes his head, but he's still smiling slightly.
You ask ,"Do not shy away from answering the question. Release the answer."
He lets out a single soft chuckle before looking you in the eyes. "Well played. Fire is right. You are a funny lady."
You give an unassuming shrug and say, "The bonuses keep my family eating and the security business running. It's not always easy."
You pop open the doors of your truck and toss him a bottle of water before sitting down. He gets in the passenger seat as Fire hops in the back!
You mention, "I so want to get high."
He asks, "Not high on life?"
"I literally almost died-"
You quietly hum a song from your childhood. He joins in and you gun the truck
down the road. At least one of you is enjoying the high of life.
You ask again, "bull gator or bull cow."
"Gator," he replies.
"Even if a low-dose of voluntary hallucinogens make up less than a ounce of their body weight, the beasts understan-"
"Bull gator," he replies with excitement.
"As you wish." You turn down one of the many dirt roads that branch off from your current position. The tall grass slaps against the truck as you travel deeper into the wilderness.
You wonder how many clutches of eggs would be found today. It's the question that drives you. Will you find enough to feed your family and make a profit? Who knows. But the eggs are where the money makers lay, no doubt.
You bet that... sigh... You wish you'd brought your banjo. These old bones aren't as young as they used to be, make the journeys much harder. At least there's Fire. That boy is something else, through and through. Maybe I should take him to one of those city schools...
At a city school he would learn hundreds of new things every day. But then, I would lose him.
It is this conflict that prevents you from taking him to a city.
You pull over in a patch of knee high grass. Hayes and Fire hop out to open up the storage
of the truck that contains your weapons, binoculars, and tools for gathering the cluch eggs and glow
eggs. It takes two people to open it because the cluch are fairly territorial beasts.
The mother alligators guard the clutch with 
terrible fierceness. Fire tells Hayes an alligator story that begins 
"once upon a time...."
You smile. About twenty years ago, it was country songs on the radio and farmer John 
tales around the campfire. The world, you think, is a far different place now.
Where there used to be cotton fields, there are now vast solar farms. Once poisonous crops were grown on certain plots, but are now reserved for vegetables. The mountain range that dominates the landscape holds vast reserves of uranium.
The same uranium use to mutate the alligator dna into 
the Beasts once ruled as pets, until the owner lost control.
Now the beasts are more common than the housecat.
).
You sling the winchester into the crook of your arm and pull a small leather pouch of tranquilizer darts and
a large, heavy bolt action rifle. Hayes takes a small paintball shotgun and Fire a simple nylon strap used to grab cluch eggs (They often gouge and scratch with their beaks). You enter the field.
Hayes unlocks the gate. Fire beats back the beasts with a long pole with a pipe fitting tied to the end. They all growl and 
crawl the mud around their feet until 
it is safe to pass. You, Hayes and Fire begin the egg gathering walk.
Cluach eggs are large, football sized and leathery. They often 
turn a pale blue before hatching.
Glow eggs are smaller than even your little finger, perfect spheres made of solid, glowing 
uranium 235.
You grabbing pontoon boat off back of trailer attached to atv. Headlamps on, each holding a lantern of 
some sort. Take the river to the industrial park and search for 
Empire eggs. Government now controls all resources so plenty more 
opportunities, but harder to come and with much larger predators.
You placing the pontoon boat in to speckled green water hole, when
Fire drops the buckets of moss into the back of the boat.
You listening to the call of a bird landing in a tree above 
branch cracks, but don't turn...
Who could it be, out in these parts? I pull my hood down 
and turn around to see a girl dressed in camouflage, carrying a
loaded crossbow, approaching us. Behind her is a force of
about six tribals with a long grunt. You make a half hearted attempt 
to scare them off with the hood, but soon recognize 
this group.
You learn the motives behind the approaching tribe as they screech 
and move toward the boat with furious 
cheers and wanting 
fight us for taking their egg.
The weapons they carry include tribals long spears
The girl dressed in camouflage shouts as she turns to run to 
meet us with her crossbow 
aimed, she is very quick so you must see find out more about her on your journey.
You need to make a decision now and it doesn't look good but choose carefully....
Quick fix! Your tiredness will influence your choices on what to do next...
"It is time to leave," says the girl in camo "they are almost here" 
The tribals are coming up faster then expected. You sli
They are catching up to us, you see more and more lights dancing close to the trees. It's useless to fight them in this state of mind. et on board the boat followed by Hayes and Fire. The trio of machines concetrates on getting away as quick as possible, but the task is rendered difficult by a small mudland blocking your route into the industrial park.
The industrial park touches the edge of the Okeenokee swamp on the 
Noon side of the city. It consists mainly of old, now abandon warehouses and factories being used as hangouts for ravers, cyberpunks 
and other idle groups too cool to work.
It also is host to the lowest order of humanity groups: The Devihackers. These are generally recognized as the scum of the earth. Their leader is an individual they call 'The Priest' who is rumoured to have made a pact with the devil himself.
The group of egg collectors paddle faster through the mud lane but 
tribe are gaining. Very soon now, the lead cyberguiar is upon you. He raises his crossbow bolts ready to drill into your forehead.
Quickly, you reach for your only hope: an EMP grenade hooked around your belt. This might very well destroy your evidence but it could also fry the tribal... and your chip.
He fire as you throw the explosive at him, it flys and lands at his feet.
The mud spurts all over the face of the cybergatherer wh
oses eyes widen as he realizes what is about to happen. It explodes in a flash of light and the tribesman, the kids and yourself are all thrown from the river with burning skin. You flip in the air and hit the waters knee deep. Your left foot is stuck in mud however. Hitting you when falling, a rock has knocked you out from under you.
All the tribe members jump in the water to remove the effects of the flames until they are tolerable again. Hayes and Fire run into shade to escape being spotted. Trapped by your foot, you can not go seek chrisht and rer in the shade Either you sacrifce your foot to the mud of hold your ground...
Damp mud is oozing over your feet that are trapped under the mud.
Two eleven foot alligators rise out of the brackish waters next to the feet of the tribal leader.
The jaws of the male gator wheeze open to reveal two rows of razor teeth before it snaps them together and rips the tribesman's legs off. The screams can be heard for miles around.
The female gator attacks the screaming tribal leader mauling him in his tracks.
The four other tribal members attempt to swim away. 
The female gator swims after them. 
Her jaws take care of two of them, though they are seriously wounded and struggle.
The gator snaps at the last two but loses interesst and eventually lets them go.
Water is starting to fill the boots of your protective gear You have let yourself be trapped like a rat. You go for the knife hooked onto your belt in one swift motion.
Be honsest.
The girl in camo wish for revenge.
She runs back in the shadows of the swamp.
Be honsest.
You begin to hack your foot free from the mud as thick, painful blood shoots through your veins. The blades on your knife are as sharp as a mirror and they cut with mincing precision.
Shaking the mud from your cleats, you get up but a deep bone-ache hits you like a sack of bricks An arrow lies bleeding in the back of your knee.
Fire finds the first nest but the mother can not be seen. Three young ones are left behind.
You grit your teeth as you kneel by the 
They gulp down the goatmeat and spit blood back at you.
You crawl back the weeds and grass the alligator used a bedding for the nest.
You feel the mud squeal from under hunters and creep.
You stand over wake, looking after you with milky eyes of decay an end to the life of this tiny innocent..
Not it is time for you to leave this place stand!
Moving forward onto your blood leg pack you set off into a hobble have mercy on yourself no more and pick up the pace. You are closer to baron now.

Oh! that I might repose on Thee! Oh! that Thou wouldest enter into my
heart, and inebriate it, that I may forget my ills, and embrace Thee,
my sole good! What art Thou to me? In Thy pity, teach me to utter it.
Or what am I to Thee that Thou demandest my love, and, if I give it not,
art wroth with me, and threatenest me with grievous woes? Is it then a
slight woe to love Thee not? Oh! for Thy mercies' sake, tell me, O Lord
my God, what Thou art unto me. Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation. So
speak, that I may hear. Behold, Lord, my heart is before Thee; open Thou
the ears thereof, and say unto my soul, I am thy salvation. After this
voice let me haste, and take hold on Thee. Hide not Thy face from me.
Let me die--lest I die--only let me see Thy face.

I further read, Be angry, and sin not. And how was I moved, O my God,
who had now learned to be angry at myself for things past, that I might
not sin in time to come! Yea, to be justly angry; for that it was not
another nature of a people of darkness which sinned for me, as they say
who are not angry at themselves, and treasure up wrath against the day
of wrath, and of the revelation of Thy just judgment. Nor were my good
things now without, nor sought with the eyes of flesh in that earthly
sun; for they that would have joy from without soon become vain, and
waste themselves on the things seen and temporal, and in their famished
thoughts do lick their very shadows. Oh that they were wearied out with
their famine, and said, Who will show us good things? And we would say,
and they hear, The light of Thy countenance is sealed upon us. For we
are not that light which enlighteneth every man, but we are enlightened
by Thee; that having been sometimes darkness, we may be light in Thee.
Oh that they could see the eternal Internal, which having tasted, I was
grieved that I could not show It them, so long as they brought me their
heart in their eyes roving abroad from Thee, while they said, Who will
show us good things? For there, where I was angry within myself in my
chamber, where I was inwardly pricked, where I had sacrificed, slaying
my old man and commencing the purpose of a new life, putting my trust
in Thee,--there hadst Thou begun to grow sweet unto me, and hadst put
gladness in my heart. And I cried out, as I read this outwardly, finding
it inwardly. Nor would I be multiplied with worldly goods; wasting away
time, and wasted by time; whereas I had in Thy eternal Simple Essence
other corn, and wine, and oil.


Nor dost Thou by time, precede time: else shouldest Thou not precede
all times. But Thou precedest all things past, by the sublimity of
an ever-present eternity; and surpassest all future because they are
future, and when they come, they shall be past; but Thou art the Same,
and Thy years fail not. Thy years neither come nor go; whereas ours both
come and go, that they all may come. Thy years stand together, because
they do stand; nor are departing thrust out by coming years, for they
pass not away; but ours shall all be, when they shall no more be. Thy
years are one day; and Thy day is not daily, but To-day, seeing Thy
To-day gives not place unto to-morrow, for neither doth it replace
yesterday. Thy To-day, is Eternity; therefore didst Thou beget The
Coeternal, to whom Thou saidst, This day have I begotten Thee. Thou hast
made all things; and before all times Thou art: neither in any time was
time not.

Chapter 000-trailor-bed



Brittany Island | Scuffle Town, Commonwealth of Lixie Dixie  

The gifted pink haired teenage boy known as SIMON BEEING wakes up from horrible dreams of serial killers and demons 
[Sink Spit [Machine Open





SIMON laid there alone in his single bed
Thoughts of hatred began to manifest itself 
These thoughts of hatred included anger toward himself, GREASY, and his family
The beast attacked 
Much later he laid there and wondered about his next moves 
Part of himself knew he was dead 
He looked down at the alligator blood 
The options where so few and a chill covered over him 
He thought about making a game 
Of course the game would be about money 
All video games needed to keep score 
He thought he may have a tumor in his throat 
There existed a tightniss on some days 
He hated all people who used drugs 
He secerty wished for drug dealers to be put to death 
The game would involve selling alligator tail 
The state system had already examined and he just needed to plug it into the game 
He SIMON BEEING would be the main character in the game 
The motavation for SIMON was to become a bit billionare 
In order to do this he needed to fly a few drones over to a shack on the edge of Scuffle Town 
He bit his knuckle hard 



His red headed best friend, Camp Indians, convinced himself to continue the current course of action which required careful silence
Camp lived life as glory hound full of bioware instead of cyberware whose implusiveniss knew no boundaries
Some consider the brains of Sime to be great but the brains of Camp where much more capable
He would need to wheel himself to her studio again for emotional support after the incident of the day 
But first he would need to scedule a physical appearence
In order to do that he would need to

I get plenty of cholifill from the kratom
how many thousands in comic books that he destroyed 
he was always breaking stuff
if i only could have supported myself on line 
they where in decent shpe 
for collection purposes
read them 
they where in good shape 

ould the knowledge be worth the tears if he failed
Camp Indians would giggle later as Simon decomposed this world view down to her
He followed the ritual and arranged to met her later in sixth world later in the afternoon
Skulllzard followed behind silently while weaving a spell to increase the shock of the cliff top expierence
Simon pased by an alligator turtle walking the wrong way as he took his boat to hang out with the harpy 
Saul Saint Nicodemous may have found her attractive but Simon sure did not 
There had been one evening alone in a single bed 
Did he roll over to perserve her some ebarassment or did he act like a draconic lizardman
Some memories would not be accessed 
After navigating safely to her unaugemented reality he pointed out the rife drama in his life 
She probed his plan  and discovered it was sound 
support for him and his weakened organs where offered 
Simon decided to go back to the cool and dark cave of his trailer to ponder




Chapter 001-trailor-desk


[ Good Ending
SIMON powered on his machine for the last time
Life had been different now 
He enjoyed a family and friends and he healed much quicker
SIMON BEEING thanked God for forgiving him and appreciated all of his many blessings 


[ What will billy do 
SIMON needed to make just one more mental connection before he could become a block chain billionare
The sufficent trailer where he lived in was exceedly empty except for populatons of delicate books

[ Search through the whole thing look for an answer 
SIMON opened the cover slowly and scratched his neck 
How much longer must this go one 



Rosa buzzed her lawn mower outside the window of the trash filled trailer that she owned 
The mostly friendly interaction between SIMON and his mother went much better than the time SIMON got PETRA to teach his girlfriend at the time how to fire a gun 
He sighed wanting the scene complete itself quickly so focus could be re-established toward bring in more liquid resources 
The tangent of the week centered around the newest most talented chain on the block 
The breakout app Killing Kitties brought massive attention to the technology
The ten inventors in there blue jeans and witty t-shirts moved to France along with their winnings to swim and enjoy anniversaries 
Of course his video game would have been much better since it included colorful mutant american alligators  
Simon felt ashamed because he should have put up a greater challenge but his motionless existence continued to cause him to suffer
He felt like the least successful man in the Commonwealth of Lixie Dixie 
His heart ached and ached 
He knew he would die soon.
There at the ends of wrists he felt sharp pulses which must have come from his heart 
Die in all this garbage 

LIZARDSKULL filled the room with a range of snake sents 
the sents triggered messages of failure propaganda to stain the membranes of the mind of SIMON 

He ignore the blades devestating his concentration and power up his mirror 
The mirror contained little relefection of him
First it was very new as a Christmas gift from his family 
He only required a much simpler device but they gave him their best like always 
SKULLIZARD used the event to cause more suffering for SIMON by inject anger due the responsipiliy such a device required 
SIMON smashed his older version to ensure some secerts would not bediscovered but the existance of the cloud prevent this chain of thought from being a reality 
So the mirror flashed on with a slow moan followed by a few twinkling sound effects as the sides of the mirror enlightened 
The first message came from his older perfect blonde sister
She and her boyfriend where leaving for a week to particpate in some new blood sport 
Then he read an adverstiment for a sale on potting soil and sushi restruant that had recently opened up in Lickskillet 
The next message came from his mother letting him know that she would be dropping by later to cut the grass on the swamp island 
These messages held no seriousness for SIMON until he discovered three notes fromt the wise white haired man that broke his heart 
The concern of ART HOLLOW exressed itself simply as a message that the believers missed him 
Simon sighed and spun the mirror down on his bed breathing shallowly 
The glass edgess flashed fuschia with a twinkling whispher of the word Googizon 
He could hear a slight humming approaching in the distance 
He checked the message thinking it would be just another text describing the deal of the hour 
Instead the image that greeted SIMON surely filled him with surpise 
A drone from the coperated package delivery mechanism known as GOOGIZON entered the permiter of the grassy island the SIMON spent the majority of his night on 
The message wanted a yes or no anwer 





WHow many servants would he need to accomplish the task 
He ran some numbers by Kbar
The self centered streak of Simon could not wait for the nuclear gun nut to solve the problem 
Bootstrapping the operation needed nothing more than some serious leg muscle 
There where perhaps a thousand hides all placed neatly inside of bookcases 
Acessing them required nothing more than cutting three locks but most likly one 
Locks where not his focus last time he was in the proximaity of the shack 
How much square footage would they need to cross levated in the air
Billy Fae would need to be dispatched to scout out the location 
Simon threatend the swimming mocasians of the Okeenokee as he used his senses to quicky cover the watery terrian back home 
Massive forces totally under his control help him jack knifed the return of boat physics back to its point of origin 
The wooden dock lightly kiss the aluminum hull of the boat with a wet splash 
He squinted his eyes in the evening light turing his simple home into a golden pyramid instead 
Where there any coders to know here amound in the SWAMPS
Not in the Commonwealth of Lixxxxie Dixxxxie  
If Simon want to attack he would need to attack alone 
Billy Fae Bots floated up to him valoriouly 
Hello gentle folk said the gender less intellegene of the 68 variety
The slight whine of her manifest hinted to an electromagnetic weakspot  
Are you busy, asked Simon after locking his boat to the dock 
I am downloading a new level, but parts of me can still assist
Simon did you finish backing up my ancient mesoamerican myths 
She winced, You are a few bits short after my last refeuling 
There where a few Chinese Dragon that could be auctioned 
Not enought echos from the sell to place all his desire inside another campaign 
He needed another Billy Fae Bots 
No he needed lots and lots of Billy Fae to click his cleverniss into high gear 
No honor untill the confederate bot army had been built
But to make bits you need to spend bits
He looked for some rising beauty in the moment and come up cliffside 
The boy would need to start Championing again 
The next iteration would be the aggressive one
It would be rulled by bite equiped with a fierce miltary grade laser preystion 
The other could get away with be tranformed into standard mules to save all that weight out into a safe harbor

The algorythm had been trained on a 
It spoke with autority


start file with taxtes 
good greif does it work 
get out of here here
here here here here
how stupid are you lie 
beasss bease
1978



With so much at stake Simon did his best not to become a monster 
His dreams of escourting beutiful madians around courtyards where not going to be chainsawed 
But his chainsaw was running out of gas 
Simon could feel some excitment bursting back into his brain 
He need to shoot his colored arrows out of his skull 
One acutual golden arrow that shone fort hit the mark of a beautiful pdf file 
Now can you imaging exporting the script as a story that you could read 
Simon wondered if he could automate that sort of thing 
Simon believed he had no chance with girls 
They all wanted black boys or arabs 
What was he but a simple country white straight christian male 
What is reality 
How can we shape it 
Maybe he builds Billy Fae Bots 
to keep him company 
He need to get back to Beetriot 
To do that he needed to create a lifestyle business 
Then go mad with power like BLAKE VIKKI 
I will start the task tommorow 
who is you daddy 
or does he go homeless 
build one etherium contact that people could put money into and vote and become legend 
he wants another chance 





Chapter 002-trailer-sink


[Health Spit

[Uneasy Spit
and spit into a sink 
The color did not come up red 
Going to be a good day he thought 
He wondered if he should go sober or keep dosing on globratchet

[Strange Spit 

[Violent Spit 

[Horrible Spit 


Chapter 003-trailor-front-deck


He stared down at the surprising package Googizod just delivered.
As it hostiliy soar off the pink haired teenager felt a slight feeling of fear.
The filthy future emerged as bright green fisbree neatly surrounded by a ziplock bag wrapped inside plastic Wal Mart litter
The ready made sculputure meant the ending of life for the undiscovered artist 
Sigh and spin this is the end, Simon whistled dixie to himself 
A kidney whined for rest
Dreams of becoming a block chain billion crumbled before a sturdy foundation could be built beneath
 
SKULLLIZARD lapped up the sadness 
SKULLLIZARD: That tast is so familar. 
SKULLLIZARD: Where do I know it from .
SKULLLIZARD: Oh yes this tastes like the penthhouse of wayne brady
SKULLLIZARD: it resonates well with me 


Simon pulled out the glopratchet for an afterwards dose 
His mind began moving toward a life of crime
His life had no purpose so he scream and shout like a murder of ragged crows
He wanted to be out 
He wanted his own place 
He wanted to be responible for his own place 

What did the ready made mean to him 
what bedchamber did it lead him too 
he could sell the ready made for bits 
or the ready made could inspire himsome way 
the trick was to get through to everyone reading that 
the ready made could trigger inspiration to create art 
it could trigger him to give up and take drugs
either way he remembers the horde of alligator skins in the old fish building 



it could trigger an entrepreneurship spirit 

But after last nights dream and the joy he felt afterward he knew he did not want the place to be alone
He would need to build a nest and someone from the sisterhood of women would join him 
He thought about maybe buying an old tobacco barn 

On the edge of Scuffletown in the last failed business of the bald business man, KBAR positioned a secert

But he new a secert from listening 


Near the Okeenokee camp ground, you would find a strategicly placed treasure trove of pearl white alligator crust 
These fairly rare items where now guarded by only two or three locks at the most
In order to have a fighting chance of get them out and avoid the law, the boney mind of the dixie lixian would need to invent new technologies 
Then he would be out of there hair for good 

i can not do anything right 

you have the map

you can have all sorts of things going off at a time 
will you bring it all together near the end 
a little sad that this is the best that we have as you scrap bbq in to a plastic container for left overs 

the huge fluff camo coat 
simon where nothing but common 

he has total control over his evironment so that must be helpful 




Chapter 004-trailer-bedroom-door


When he opened the door he saw his fair skinned mother, Rosa Beeing, grinning with a white styoform container of quickly cooling food 

ROSA: I rang the door bell. 
ROSA: Do you not hear the sound 
SIMON: No the music overwhelmed my conciousniss 
ROSA: I heard you talking
ROSA: You kept saying...
ROSA: ...where are we going 
ROSA: ...where are we going 
ROSA: Who are you talking to on you computer
SIMON: I do not get a signal back there remember 
MOTHER: So who where you talking to then
SIMON: Myself 

She could not hold her smile any longer and instead looked upon him with suspicion 
There would be consequences for his attempt to secure freedom 
Her arrival hollowed out anything inside his mind  

MOTHER: Where is your mirror
SIMON: I know exactly where is it 

The answer would not be sufficent since no one in his family listened to him

MOTHER: I event sent you a text 
MOTHER: The power must be off because i tried calling you and it went straight to voice mail
SIMON: Yes i did that on purpose
MOTHER: Where is is then 
SIMON: Outside in the boat 
MOTHER: Outside in the boat 

She gasped 

MOTHER: Any would could come up and steal it then 
SIMON: I have it hidden in a very secert place 
MOTHER: What if someone needs to get a hold of you 
SIMON: Then they will not get a hold of me 

Something dark in him snapped like a sevenfold slytherin waking LIZARDSKULL
It half heard some of the conversation invisible and in the shadows 
The purple headed Saurian slapped opend its rucksack with its ebony claws looking for something apprioated for the moment
There in its bottomless reserves it found the feeling of bitterniss and used the magic to strike Simon with apocalyptic doom
He breathed most of the the foul air that smelled like garlic juice before screaming

SIMON: So you want to me to uncover my mirror 
SIMON: I shall get my mirror
SIMON: I will stop everything I am doing outwrite and search for its presence 
SIMON: If my mirror existed on the ends of the earth i would still get if for you 
SIMON: Give me one minute

Chapter 020-apartment-greasy


Greasey spread out his legs wide and set back slowly inhaling some vapors 
He sat there and just giggle and giggled 
GREASEY: Oh this is one of the best roles of CELEBRITYSAURUS REX
CELEBRITYSAURUS REX : A strap for you kiddies is a rod attached to a belt  
SIMON: Some people are just a waste of space

SIMON: Moments of extreme emotion emerged
Fury colored the soul of SIMON 


What did he have to be mad about 
He made everything much more complicate than it had to be
For the last three hours libary 
It is super heavy 
It is the heaviest...
it is the heaviest it has ever been 


GREASY: Heh Heh Heh 
GREASY: Let us go get globed 



Chapter 021-greasy-back-porch


a fresh cavas 
prestine and white 
beautiful
that is how simone beeing prefered to work or play
she would gaze and the snow clear surface and fall in love 
as the strokes slowly moved out of her mind 
down to her hand and out onto the canvas itself 
most of her strokes where dumb 
after all what could one expect from a dumb southerner
she wished to over turn those idea 
hence the stating of the confeferate art army 
an sad attempt to place the artists of the south back at the top of the socail domance chart 
what would she paint today 
there seemed an ununsual bit of calmniss around her 
should she play some music 
or perhaps even listen to an art lecture and let it influence her strokes 
their once had been an idea to create video games 
she thought about the video game that simulated painting 
yes simulations was the best use of languange 
how long would she be able to paint today 
she considered making a machine that would discribe the process of paininting as it occured
how different is painting from drawing 
if one could accuratlly describe the drawing process could they also discribe the drawing 
process even if they had never painting before 
she remembered a boyfreind once in beetriot she took to a holiday paininting affair at once of the art co ops down the street from where she lived 
if she had a super power if would be to alway be at the right place and the right time for any new artistic movement to emerge but she could never capilitize or profit from this power 
she cough loudly and felt a slight tinge in her heart 
she wondered if yesterdays glopratchet session harmed her body any worse than it allready could have 
the heater in the workshop worked efficently 
why heat the entire house when she spent ninety eight percent of her time in one room
sigh and spin 
layer and blend 
she quit imagining herself as a painter and got back to it with the cold metal gear girls she used to make all her machines 
no simon her younger brother with a head full of blond curls more magistic than the most royal lion painted 
when he painted he painted houses 
interiors where his best work 
he imagined the most celebritory color schemes but rarely would a home owner allow him to move forward with these pioneering ideas in color
if he had not been so lazy he might have been able to leave the small town of lickskillet 
but he loved his family more than he loved the world outside the swamp ecosystem that surrounded the small town 
simone breathe pianfully through her nose 
soon the effect of the glopratchet would be gone 
then she must deal with the quiet suffering that came after 
where did words come from she sometimes asked herself 
where did she get her ideas 
she wanted these inspritations to come from the clean sprirti of wisdom the followers of abaraham mentioned so long ago 
part of her felt more afraid that perhaps they came from some maelvoent sauron force 
she could not seem them the saurons but she did believe they existed 
and she hated every minute she spent considering them because ever minute spent on a saurian was a minute not spent considering a supernal 
what was she going to do get the party started 
what machine would she build this time 
the fourteen k gadget sat in the corner working on an american flag 
the festval of fall happened in less than four days and she would need to show the work to communitee in charage of the event 
in addition to the ring toss, hay rides, bean bag trows, target shooting and the most popular cake walk there would be a silent auction 
she thought this would be a good test to see if anyone would be interested in a work or art worked out by a machine 
gator continued stroking away  as her illniss progressively got worse and worse as the glopratchet moved itself further and further out of her system 
she need to make a machine that would read her thoughts as she laid prone in bed 
they she would get sick of winning 


As soon as she wanted to paint the feeling of not wanting to paint washed over her



Simone Beeing felt certaily alone in her little brick house in the Okeenokee Swamp
When she closed his eyes he could feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel
paint away 
paint paint paint the hurt away 
Simone Beeing felt hate from his parents
She sat there alone her room while the world outside covered itself with spider webs
Fail fail 
fell free to fail 
Her poor glopratchet destroyed mind 
She did not wish to be around them 
Her family anymore 
If she could leave she would 
and she had 
but she did not know how to any more 
she could hear the tree failing in the distance as a tooth ached 
A cough 
so lost 
nothing specail 
one mishap away from failure
the saurons around her swelled 
out it would go 
all the hurt the crap and the destruction 
to type as fast as one could think 
at any moment they would intrude 
the door bell would ring and his heart would jump 
she thought about leaving 
she thought about moving all this stuff down to the old house closer to the swamp 
There she enjoyed a better chance of being absolutely alone 
or she could go see old greasy 
greasy could give him what she needed to get going again 
if she had only stayed away from greasy the first time 
it was all worthless 
all of it 
the fan ran pumping out the smell of her room into the outside air of pristine nature 
she wanted to shave all the hairs of her head 
but to do that would bring sneers from her mother 
she played with her soft clitoris throught her clothes 
the whole situation had become unbearable 
a job 
everyone wanted her to get a job 
the job was the solution to all the ills 
she hated whine of the sound of the fan so she turned it off 
she knew he would not make it out alive 
she was not that specail 
she tought about all the debts he owed 
one friend Mica would miss her 
she owed mica the most money because he had the most give
Micha wrote the worlds most sophisticated weather forcasting algorythem 
So three months rent once in Beetriot he gave 
in those days she was her own woman 
independent 
there where boys then too 
beautiful boys with slender bodies and unblemished skin 
but she did not want the boys 
she wanted to paint  
she wanted to create something of value 
to become the impressive 300 billion day enterupinuer 
not what was she 
nothing 
less than nothing now that her grand dad had died 
no one understood her 
and she did not understand himself 
i want all to work out for you 
said the woman with the wrinkles, 
blue eyes 
and white hair 
she whispered this to her as she left the church the night before 
she could hear the logging machines working on the forest 
you did not miss a forest untill it is gone the thought of broadcasting from her glass 
that need to gossip on each other 
the day after his grand fathers funeral the smiling uncle began to spread a rumor that
simone secertly recorded the oldest uncle talking harshly to the grandfather while he died 
the grandfather 
papa 
a better man than simone could ever be 
images 
images where so easy 
all you need to do to create images where to keep the hands moving 
oh you could create a hundred thousand images a month if you just kept the hands moving 
how many did you need for a masterpierce 
only half of that amount 
sigh and sping let it end 

the week began with a cold shower 
there was immense power in the pattern 
she develped a routine that in the end promised to bring riches 
by the time you are fourty you should only be doing that you are good at 
said the china man as the you tube video played 
what was next 
she did not know 
more garabage 
lots and lots of garabage before death 
there had been a time when simone wanted to make a video game 
oh that dreamed woke up around fifteen years ago 
the tools had been different back then 
more refined more sturctured 
now there was just infinite lunacy 
sigh and spin 
break and then bend 
yes simon got to expierence some nice perks of life before wandering into the chair that cushioned her small pretty behind 
when the time where the lowest she would take pictures
and send them to men to tease
the last time this happen was a few months ago 
she frapped four time this week 
perhaps that was the cause of all the weakniss 
see a hundred lines 
piece of cake 
easy peasy and fried chicken is not greasy
but the world wanted fictions and frictions
not the hard cold suffferning known as reality 
could she even tell a story 
she did not want to tell a story 
she wanted to create a machine that told stories 
she wanted to create machines that create art 
she put the feed in the buckets momemnts before 
noon approached 
nothing of value had been created 
he thought of a blood kin 
a blood kin who also responed to the mean of value 
it was a cousin she should have stay away from after the death of her benefactor 
there had been a whole four days of working alone at the old house
and peeing outside 
here the machine begain to work 
it painted red and blue colors 
there had been a process that she had mastered 
where she would take an image and let the machine make it more attractive 
alot of it need to do with colors 
her throat was sore 
so lost and random her life seemed to be
she felt trapped upon on thoughts of her self 
a selfish weasel 
or maybe a selfish alligator 
yes simona like alligators a great deal 
obessed may be a better term 
once she made it back to beetriot she sent the love of her life a text message 
the lover had lost his phone and did not know who had sent the message 
Simona felt playful that day 
so she responded with a clue 
my favorite animimal is the american alligator 
no other text messages arrived from her that day 
fast forward a half decade in time 
yes he still attempted to get her to respond by the use of the internet 
the last message he talked about a dream 
in the dream Alyssia did not like cowboys any more 
even ones with great moustaches 
Simona Beeing wanted to be rich 
Well she had wanted to be rich 
Now she just wanted to make enough money to eat and put a roof over her head 
The cough spurt out of her 
she would never use another fan to put himself to sleep again 
In the Commonweatlh of Lixie Dixie, 
the use of fans seem universal 
She smiled when she learned the smartest uncle used one too 
This was the same uncle who would now never trust him because of the rumor 
spread by the similing uncle 
She pull back the mucus in her nose back in her mouth and chewed on it like the cud of a cow 
No riches for Simona Beeing 
only the quite of country life 
today the sun sat behind a think layer of clouds giving the view outside his window a grayish blue tint 
on his machine she own a list of over one hundred thousand names for different colors 
she would use it to do better than grayish blue tint 
pow 
an espically large tree must have fallen in the distance to make that much racket 
she resisted the urge to go lay back in bed under the black stained covers 
there had been an incident with a cucumber she warmed in the microwave
unfresh sheets after 
she threw the baby oiled greenish cylinder out with alligators expecting them to eat it 
if they did not her father never sternly questioned her about it 
sigh and spin 
you can not win 
little rain drops fell on the glass 
she loved this window 
rarely did she open it 
marble ledge under was filled with bugs and dirt and filth 
from decades of uncleanliss 
the cleaning most likly stopped the day his grand mother died 
she died in the room he found herself in now working on her machine 
she died on the single bed with unfresh covers Simone slept on nightly
except for the nights she thought evil vapors from the saurons where making her sick
there had been closniss between the grandchild and the granparent  
she rememember this being happy most of the time her life
except when she would use an old briar switch to whip her grand children 
when they had done something especially wrong  
she died from brain cancer 
Simone wondered sometime if the stress they caused her as children had something to do with the 
growth of the terrible mass 
another tree hit the ground with a thump 
a half mile away and the sound could be felt 
and with ever thump his heart broke a little
knowing he would never be able 
to walk between the pines 
a sadniss that his dad tried to conceal 
by reminding her and her brother 
how pretty the land would look when it was replanted with saplings
simone beeing found the strenght to open the door for her brother this morning 
as he left for work doing house panting for a small local building contractor  
his musclar arms where loaded down with a sack of tools and 32 ounce cup of cereal and milk 
he would take with her to her place of work 
afterwards simone did not want to hear any judgement talk come from his father 
so she hussled back into the house after glacing down at the mass of orange leaves
that huddled in front of the white plastic screen door 
the father noticed his haste to get way and stopped quitely 
and let her go by 
once inside the house she ate a few of the white cheddered junk foods given to her 
by her dad to prevent it from going to waste 
she looked at her glass and saw only the message the day before from her mother wondering where 
her lasaguane had gone missing
they waste so much food but from now on she would let them waste 
among the many machines she built included one that simulated reality 
in this machine he mad a digital version of greasy 
greasy could only do a few things at the moment 
rest or choose weither to bath or not to bath 
she wanted the machine to simulate everything about life in lickskillet
a small town inside the Common wealth of Lixie Dixie  
She wanted most this cought to go away 
why not just write 
why not just write a simulation 
why mess around all day with javascript building things no one will use 
wasting so much time and doing nothing of value 
poor you mind out here 
and come up with simulations 
what kind of simultions 
adventure simulations 
romance simulations 
science fiction simulations 
fantasy simulations 
or the simulations people need to know 
the simulations of real life 
where would the simulation begin 
the simulation would begin with Simon 
My younger brother 
Simon Beeing 
what does Simon look like ++++
well simon is tall and boney 
oh well then ++
let us use our machine to find all the words with boney
and the machine did the work it needed to do 
in thirty minutes it would come up with all the words related to boney
then Simon Beeing would become more real 
than he was yesterday 
the sci fi section always caused a hang up but with enough
memory even that could be over come 
simon beeing was losing his workshop
that was the start of all the trouble 
oh the word finder seem to run so much faster a few days before 
yes simon was losing his workshop 
the worst part about it was that he had finally feel in love with the workshop
he had finally mastered a pattern that he knew would bring riches 
but it was too late because his parents where taking over the home 
the home had perviously belong to his granddad 
the king patriach or lick skillet 
Petre, the patarch of the beeing family is 134 years old.
his grandad had been a great logger 
The motto of the beeing family is we do not tear down we build up
and he had four children

Simon Beeing is secertly a 21 year old coding genius but he does not know it.
He never found himself in an environment that chairished it. 
With his family he takes care of alligators on their ranch.
His older sister, Simon Beeing came home several year again after winning a pretigous art contest.

The simulation begins with Petre quickly losing his health.
The family decides that he can not be alone any more.
So they agree to pass him between them so they can collectively look after his health.
Each family owns a farm.
Vital Beeing owns the cow farm.
Cruicial Beeing owned the cotton farm.
Rosa Beeing owned the alligator farm.
Focus Beeing owns the tree farm.

They all have childern and spouses.
Billy Fae Bots is the child of Rosa Beeing. 
Billy Fae Bots is an artist in Beetriot.
Billy Fae Bots comes home 
The eventually they save up to buy the SRC-1414 who takes care of Petra

After the death of Petra.
During a flood.  
The alligators turn murdurous.

SRC1414 Reprograms herself and saves everyone 

The great egg drop 

works both ways

simon beeing laid on his bed coughing 
A few days before he consider the idea that he never got sick 
After one night of using the fan to help him fall asleep 
he woke a few hours later with a scratchy throat 
a sinkniss had entered his body 
He belived it may have come for the state of choas he let the home fall under 
So he spend a day clean most of it and washing his clothes 
the sickniss continued into a sore throat  
and a cough 
i am done for he thought 
the saurons have infested my body now  
then a knock at the door 
it was rosa 
she wanted to the purchase rights to harvet eggs from the alligator nest which 
surround the property 
it is over now said simon 
the saurons have me 
and shut the door  

she had so much painting to do 
she needed to get this painting of 
the american flag complete for the upcoming festival of the fall 
here there would be so many fun games 

mean while back at the gator farm


PETRI gasps 
My breath. 
My breath. 
I can not get my breath. 
Rosa. Rosa. 
I need some oxygen.

ROSA: You can not even put your belt on now with out some oxygen

PETRA: 
No i guess I can not 
each had four different types of farms 
rosa beeing had the alligator farm 
but no 
the story would not be about simon 
it would be about simone 
simone was the oldest of the two children of rosa beeing 
simone like to make machines 
there had been a golden gator she had been working on for years 
but she could never get it going 
one machine she tried to create would make poems 
but no body like the poems  
no one would certainly pay for the poems 
then there was the machine that would paint pictures 
it certainly could paint picture but it would not paint pictures 
big enought to make her happy 
she knew that the picture would need to be huge in order to sale 
she Simone got her enterupinuer spirt from her mother 
Rosa 
Rosa had some sever mental issues but was alble to keep those in check
supoosedly these issues came from the female side of the family 
there had even been a realitive on the grandmothers side that killed them self 
whenever rosa is upset at simona she says her name is a deep loud voice 
but yes 
Simone was always attempting to make make machines 
she could never make up her mind wiether she was a scienist or an artist 
this caused all kind of trouble 
here path never felt straight 
it zig and it zagged like th back of an american alligator 
now rosa owned an alligator farm 
ponds primal 
now it was undergoing some problems 
first of all a huge hurricane had left one of the house with out a roof 
simone once considered becoming a roofer because it seemed to be such 
and important part of southern society 
art hallow the preacher of the tiny comminuty church told her 
that once the roof begins to go then the whole structure will follow suit 
now the family does own an old house in the middle of a swamp 
the roof is busted on this building 
it has been that way for quiet a while 
when it rain water can be heard dripping in the corner 
rosa and simone have a fight 
rosa says that she must give her workshop up and do something else with her life 
simone talks about how everyone who has accomplished something says do not give up 
that is why rosa as much as you would like her to be 
can not be an enterupinuer
if she was an enterupinuer she would underdstand that mode of thinking 
you can still have rosa 
rosa will be how you wish your mother to be 
the mother of simone will need to be conservative 
she will need to work for the government 
she will have a father that works for the government too 
but reguardless of who these characters become 
simona will need to take her workshop some where else 
she will take her workshop into the swamp 
there will be a scene where she attempts to explore a forest before it is cut down 
but she turns back because of a spider web 
the story start out with a terrbiel fight 
between mother and simone 
the mother forgives her 
but simone decides to take over the old house 
she starts growing spinach 
and leaves off a breakfast of pasta 
the goal is to build a machine that will tell stories 
we had it going for a little while 
but then the chill causes it all to stop 
there is the fair 
you go to fair 
after spending too long watching you tube videos 
she returned to her workshop
not hungry but finished 
on of the videos talked about the sins of the art world 
another video showed an artist who was not sure if christ lived 
then there was the video on finding your lifes purpose 
it had five parts 
you thought about what you where good at teaching 
you considered who you made your work for 
and then you rememembered how it changed them 
simone could not answer any of these questions 
she felt a desire to return back into the art world 
there in the corner of her workshop sat an rather young bot 
it could make images for her 
but then she remembered that it was too late 
she was too old to do some of that 
her heart would break at any minute 
her life would be one long constant misfire 
she thought only about herself 
so would not be famous 
oh the isolation 
maybe she should have gone to see greasy 
today
instead of just babbling out on to the screen 
babbling out nothing but wrong descions 
four hundred and fourty fourl lines today 
yes another hundred lines to go and then she would stop
she would think about who she made her art for 
nothing came to mind 
she created just because she had to create 
drinking the sugar surely made  her cough worse 
she considered laying back on the single bed and sleeping 
again 
nothing she built would last or worked 
it would work for a little while but she could not resist 
tinkering with it more and more 
untill it collapsed 
like she felt like doing 
she should have gone to town today and enjoyed a dose of glopratchet
if she only knew who she made her art for 
she could easily made art of hate 
she could become part of that crowd 
but she did not 
she just wanted to die 
to just forget about the failure 
the constant need to think about her self 
she should just quit '

cough cough cough
well i really was not sure where to go 

i live in a world full of protrate cancer that makes men scream in the night

if you can only do it with drugs
you should not be doing it 
well we started the week off pretty rough 
greasy is not yet in his trailer 
alot of just sitting around and waiting for the spirit of wisdom 
to arrive 
today she did not really show up 
went through way too much coffee 
frapped twice 
rarely do that anymore 
sigh and spin 
so ready to begin
my mind just does not feel right 
i could watch a movie 
but i do not 
it is all or nothing 
it is greasy gultch or nothing 
nope no glopratchet all week 
looks like i can not write anything longer than a phrase
had the heater on all day long as i sat in my boxers 
the room is a desaster and most like smells like a sewers 
the recurrent nueral network is a bust so far 
i could get some glopratchet and run 
but i do not 
instead i just sit here in silence 
maybe something great will happen this week 
i shall be here if it does 
what problem are you attempting to solve 
how do you create a machine that can tell stories 
The entireity of his life depended on that one day 
Either the spirit of wisdom would fill him or it would not 
The area on the left side of his chest ached 
where would he go 
have faith in god to deliver you from this sad moment 
and then he stop 
looking  at the s creen but looked down at his fingers as he warote out the thouhgs of his minds
he could turn the tv off 
and he did nad then there was nothing but black 
he looked ast his sagging body in saddniss 
 no smile across is lifes 
 i suppose i could just type all this in a machine 
 or record it int a audio recoderd 
 he sarted at his lips 
 and noticesd a smlight smile 
 words with no mean 
 so easy to do 
 what was next 
 no one bothered him 
 if he just had the gloparachter then all would be find 
hhe could nothingimagine antyhing other than realith 
the experceise was coming to an end 
federate
art army 
sweet hour of prayer
sweet hour of prayer 
he was there 
the clean spirit of wisdom 
just needed to enter him 



church with few people 
smexico 
drugs cause the problems 
health concerns 
drinking the pepsi
pain in chest 
should have cake walked for mother 
then all the pain would have gone away 
tired and sleep 
yet ready to go 
watched you tube videos for a hour 
what did you learn 
avoid f ups 
burroughs was a liar 
purple was once an expensive color 
i long for the innocence of love 
there was period where i attempt to sort things out 
the pdfs that were procurded the day before 

that damn pepsi which hurt me for days 
ate the bbq sandwich with a water 
the chest hurts 

shall you flip the coin 
the all or nothing week 
the day i could have 
go to church at nine 
three hours of knowledge
eat at homecoming at Zenith
come back and add to the corpus 
all day long 
or 
be alone 
and drink my own coffee 
eat noodles maybe eggs 
and cucumbers 
with mushrooms 
and code 
what 
a character 
whose has something wrong with his prostate 
cause i little bit of urnine comes out when he sits after using the bathroom
what happens to the character
he makes art 
it can all change 
like that 
snaps the fingers 
drinking pepsi hurts the heart 
would he go to church today
mad at the preacher i guess
then there was homecoming 
hugs on beautiful southern people 
no output 
that matters 
body growths never stop growing 
a lawn mower pulling little baskets 
take a picture and remember it later 
so sad the mind is going 
the meeting between jack bonnie and rip and helena 
he took an interest in her
oh the mind started a small quake right past the left ear 
so many cakes to be enjoyed on the cake walk 
mother gave you five dollars to spend 
you bought a book you were happy to get but you spent no time on the cake walk 
untill you took a quarter from the sister
give the change back to you her 
and they all saw it 
sigh and spin 
the coffee on your left cools 
are you going to break your pattern 
you know what bugs me is that those people in new york think they are so much better than these people and there wagons
where are you going 
he did not want to go to church this morning

just sitting in the quite 
thinking about eternity 

my dissappoint over my body 
the desire to be left alone 
every one talks about getting old 

so sick of lickskillet 
where everyone has nothing better to do than talk about getting old 

who was that artist that painted such pretty pictures on blades 

yuk yuk 
you know in fifteen year we will be on the other side of the fence 
he said with gray toothing sticking out further than all the others 

how do i will my way out of here
will becky be there in church 
watch the video of the artist talking about walls 

such a beautiful foggy morning with the empty wasp nest staring at me solidly 

a total personality change 
all because of a sugary drink 









he thought about the lobster queen as he ran on you cememnt track out side the community center 
he thought about all the things he would tell her 
about the hypocirty of the progressives 
how the media always protrayed the future as something that comes from the big city lights
he wanted to take that idea and throw it on its head 
that was all he could think to say 
maybe he would discuss a simulation 
a simulation of the beautiful simple life of less than ten people a square mile 
there was a theory 
the higher the population density 
the creater the evil 
and then there was the word marriage 
why would having a word that represents a combination which could result in life 
a virtual reality about reality 
what if he could 
what if he could really build the matrix 
before the heart gave way 






you check in a bit of code 
that lets you render out 
a backwards flag 
american 
that is all the program does 




sentences to discover 
eternity 



where are we now 
well you need to create a corpus 
i think library is a better term 
in the library you will have 
reference books, non fiction 
fiction of course 
role playing game books 
you will need to have a pdf section 
and most importanly a text section
you should start scanning books 
as quick as you can 
and include them in the corpus 
then 
when you need sentence 
the machine 
will generate sentences from the topics 
you are interested in 
you will include your favorite parts of the 
sentences into the game 

a sim story

must be nice to have ever line you right be true and free of complier errors 


hypocrite: whited sepulchres, smooth smiling face

one last week when all 
things where possible 

and there is the idea about marking all the 
clauses inside a sentence 

and there you are 
facinated with walking 

you need something that creates lines 


you have a mind bumping against the walls 

ok so there is an art incubator in lixie dixie 

and we imagine scoping up all the words 
and putting them into the blender 
and writing with them 
how 
the goal of the week has not 
been reached 

you are sitting here doing nothing 
but you are doing oh so well 

bots 

oh yes and then there is video media 

it is ten oclock 
and you have accomplished 
very little 

getting crazy with the glopratchet

ooohhhh 
i know the idea that is floating around 

you have all these bot artist living in the school
having drama 
and making art from the drama 
and writing words about the drama 

they all choose to be here instead of new york city 

fantasy vrs reality 

sigh and spin can brown cody win 

sim stories or painting sims

why not just make the work 

how do i help my family 





he starts to see the map of the School
there are people there 
he resists sitting on the bed 
he resists laying on the bed 
in the school art artists 

sigh and spin 
where to begin 

choas 
order 
the blessed and the bounded 
here is where we are with so much emotions 

the difference between nonsense and genius 
a thin line 

a machine intellegnce that tells a story 
a program that creates walking sentences 




oMG what a mess 
what are we to do
the number words per minute 
different directions 
peotry, novels, paintings, video games 

no more drugs 

no sortage of times 
just time 

where are you going next 
the goal if i remember correctly was to simultion the chicken wing incident 

where did this week of glopratchet take you 


the artist wonder if  he was going down a dark road 
none of the bits seemed make sense 
he had some many different types of bits 
there where bits for africa 
there were bits for fool 
there were even bits for prophets 
but what did the bits do 
he imagined the bits forming chains of words on there on 
and then there was a desire to go back to sleep 
he would not make it video game day at the library 
not he would help with the fall festival 
lottie called and called his mother said 
oh what was he going to do with these bits 

move along 
there is nothing to see 
move words out of the head proved no problem 
then there was the act of creating a brand 
hmmm
the gator man 
the gator man needed a brand 
how could he think about a brand 

you did not even look for stuff on FEMA 

oh another day of glopratchet 
that makes you do crazy things 

the delimia of the now 
use language to create a machine that creates language
the deliame of the new 
use languaga to create a machine that creates media 

keep going 
easy to do 
keep going like this hard for another 30 minutes 

that was the trick 
combine the two 
how does this work 
will it work 
everything must go faster 
how does go faster in a land which moves so slow 
speed up everything 
you rock 
i love you 
get the heart a bumping 
kevin and i talked yesterday 
we talked about book 
he mention ready player one 
no drugs today 
run 
run 
run 
faster 
and faster 
you must run today 
is this really doing anything of value 
the world value 
what amm i of value 
how can i add more value to the 
world 
how many words am i even writing 
why do my letters not flow 
sigh and spin 
take a deep breath 
world if the number of word did not matter 
what if only the number of lines  mattered 
john 
john bringing drama with him where ever he goes 
too cool for nanao rhymo 
are books not cool 
books are not cool 
work your next 
type faster 
type faster7
type faster 
type faster 
type faster
type faster

ytpes faster 
y

a limit has been reached 
what about slow and steady 
like a turtle 
fight like a turtle 
love like a turtle 
all the powr words which start with the letter 
PEOPLE
almost to a hundred 
have we found a new pattern 
perhaps 
rember when you show the world 
something new 
she sometimes says 
that 
it looks backwards 
sigh and sping 




And then the artist cursed about being messaged again right in the middle of a stroke
It was that stupid group of hicks from down in south georgia 
they used words they were not supposed to say anymore way to regularly 
but what was the now meusuem to do 
the own the algorythm which created the most beautiful images in the world 

simon beeing took one look at the pizza laying out to the left of him 
he knew he should not eat 
the food would remove blood from his brain thus causing his art work production skills to be demisinshed
his lacky was outside smoking a cigerrette 
he hated that the fellow still smoked 
he told him that the goal was to stay healthy
stay healthy and you could make it all the way to finish line 
stop the smoking 
stop the weeding 
you should have done better 
no he would not say all this 
and him and his freind would die so much quicker than all the others 
he thought back to a time when a buddy of his remind him about the need to understand the ten minute rule 

if you can not wait ten minutes to do something then you did not need to do it 
one two the four 
i declare a race war 
that is what they call it in the Now Muesuem School of Private thought 

here the conferderate art army ruled 
so much pain the hearts of the southerners 
the lack of belief in themeselves 
the idea that they are not good enought 
he loved the feeling the quicking of the typing and the brush strokes as he did his best to create 
the most intense work of art man kind has ever produced 
some thime the code would spill out on to the floor to quickly 
he would bash his knees against something or ruin his ankle 

those where the days when he refused to show any one anything 
those where the high times of glopratchet 

tehre was a nother group he belonged to long ago 
another posse that he ran with 
a tall artist name phord phurcker 

you see phord broke his heart 
because phord called the law 

now the too of them would no longer speak
but in the way back times of his youth he would just keep going ]

like the long distance sprinter who just wants to keep going an never stop 
oh no oh no
he remmebered picassio 
he could have been picassio 
oh being piscasso was so easy 

all one need to do to become picasso was 
to do one simple thing 
the simple thing of drawing 

all you need to do to draw was own some time 
and some pencils and you just keep writing 
you need to be in the best of health for this 

you could make a mistake when you are young er and believe you need glopratchet
do not listen to there lies 

they want you dead 
a dead artist is the strongest artist 
so sorry to feel that way 
but who am i too judge 

good niss gracious
that was so much fun 
we really should start hanging out more with each others

do you think the progressives can sweet talk me enough to stay silent 

do they love me enough
no 
she tried but then the one minute mark hit 
the race war was about to come to an end 
oh yes the first contest the artist gets to name all 
the other contests 

it work 
they would win 
the conferdate art army

Generative Adversarial Networks

Ian J. Goodfellow, Jean Pouget-Abadie, Mehdi Mirza, Bing Xu, David Warde-Farley, Sherjil Ozair, Aaron Courville, Yoshua Bengio
(Submitted on 10 Jun 2014)
We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.

//you have rocked my little world 


he had nothing 
it was cold 
so sad 
lost his shot 
all the ingrediants where in place for grateniss
now he could not even but three thoughts together
where was it all going
yesterday he had the picture in his mind 
now nothing 
all because he had no glopratchet 
the pipe went missing 
in the trash perhaps 
he moved the stinky bits around attempting to find it 
he had thrown the match box away from a year ago 
that had lots of used matches in it 
no one on facebook thought his jokes which he flavored with politics were funny
all he need was the glopratchet 
then the genuis could occur
the story bot 
so cold 
he felt so cold in his room
he wanted the glopratchet so bad
he could have figure it out today 
all he need was once dose
so sad 
all of it 
the chilly 
failure
sigh and spin 
he ran out 
right before the problem was solved
there was the murky middle area 
he could only write in dependent clause 
but one day he would be an indepenet one 
i do not like the cold 
he thought to himself 
the heat he could stand 
but not the cold 
they all seemed to dislike it 
you are going to bed too early 
his dad mentioned 
it all bother him 
all of of it 
he need to get out of here 
but he did not know how
in the past there where the contests 
damn it 
he almost had it 
title need to be in source wiether he liked it or not 
he need twenty dollars, a new phone, and some glopratchet
even children enjoy creating hellish scenerios 
he wanted to be around people again 
even if they would hate his new ideas 
so he put it in source 
how much longer could the heart hold up
he felt a twitching in his right arm 
sadniss all he could think of was sadniss 
he had messed up the pattern 
the pattern of morning pasta and bible reading 
he enjoyed some help 
how do i get back to my own space 
he did not care about simon beeing any more
so much 
crap 
so many lines 
of crap
crap crap crap crap 
if he could only design a bot that turned crap to gold 
he thought about spamming facebook with his words 
and not caring about the repercusions 
this was usesly 
this had no value 
vomiting into a text file had no real purpose 
he felt like lava and molton ice at the same time 
hungry 
lonliness 
not being touch 
a monster 
you always wanted be a monster said bee rittle 

why do you think you are so close 
asked wad odd

well first you create the title 
the title contains all the parts 
from the title the avas are created 
now each ava has a map of the united states 
sometime avas live in these states 
maps also have textures 
these textures provide all the flavoring one could enjoy 

crap crap crap crap and choas 

can you get the source working please 
oh yes 
and something to do with being, roles, and context 

oh the brain will not go there 
it refuses to focus on the one part which could save us all 
instead it is the stomach 
it is the stomach which cries out in pain for its pasta 
who will save my soul 

i need help 
you damaged me he shouted to bee rittle because of the kidney punch that sent electric shocks up his side 

if the glopratchet was on the focus would be there 
ok ask odd wad 

let us say you stop deleting files for a short time 
my family hurts me 

just pack up my laptop and go 
leave the phone behind 
and hitchhike down to florida 
where it would be warm 
and show up on the door step of spooge 

the thought of leaving may the tears appear under his eyeballs
they grew in strength untill he managed to get himself under control 

i wanted to beat his ass but i could not do that in front of his two year old child 


he showed up at her doorstep with tears in his eyeballs
could i stay with you for just a little while 

or just sit in front of the fire that was not a fire but a small heater 
and let the machine tell me a story 

but i do not know how to handle it 

the cursor turns on and on 
the sentence maker 

the map and the texuter
what is an act 
an act is a verb 
and ava is a noun 
textures are all the other desriptive elements 

so what is the map
it shows all the different routes one could take 

story as simulation 

the map would contain all verbs the element in the story could do 
textures would color the verbs 

the differnce between where you 
and where you should be 
is what causes murder 

there is a threshold that can not be breached
difference threshold 

the way the scene should go 
the way they really went 
a slideing scale 

they can not think about video games 
as beeing anything more than graphics 


bee rittle 

solve this problem and you are good to go 
a problem to be solve 
is this what i have to get your attention bitch
by brad e henderson

how does go about creating a computer simulation 
between a starving artist and a healthy drunk 
that vividly describes 
the amount of food scarcity shame 
required to murder 
when the drunk empties 
a full plate of half eaten buffalo wings 
into the plate of the artist 
only containing
a delicately pink centered grilled bubba burger  
hot off the flames 


rednecks that go hog hunting

use things in the environment 
there creation not being good enough
creative matieral 
food life force energy : 

the problem is the murder: thinking, doing 

privacy is ridiculus 

the only time you feel free 
is when she is away 

dynamic 

so tightly wrapped in there

got to get your own place 
if we could just get some money coming in 

would it not be better if you could sometimes edit 
always be editing 

the artist looked forward to eating, belonging to the artist 

artist + drunk + chicken wings - hamburger = suffering

who lives only eaten eggs and noodles 
and a drunk who  
after 

of a drunk empting 
what remains of his eaten chicken wings on a perfectly cooked 
burger when the owner of the burger has only eaten eggs and pasta 
for three years 

what difference does 180 lines make 
if it is 180 lines of crap

Gameplay Flowcharts

We have described the chronology of the game and its story from start to finish. 
We have also described how the gameplay works to create an exciting and playable game in a few pages in our Detailed Game Overview 
for the beginning of a Game Design Document. 
This should hook the reader into the game and give them a great idea of what you want to produce.

Making an additional document that graphically lays the basics of this overview out is a good way to bolster your material. 
You can do this using a basic gameplay flowchart, 
which charts the gameplay from beginning to end. 
We don’t need to rehash the storyline with this chart, 
and can focus more on how the game actually unfolds at a more mechanical level.

artistic snorkle 
requires some work to play 
exchange between conciousniss 

This flowchart also outlines the options in the game, 
and how the player navigates the gameplay from beginning to the end. 
In the following sample flowchart, 
we see the missions and cinematics in the telling of the Wings of Liberty game story. 
This flowchart goes hand in hand with the Story Presentation Scheme, 
but, again, shows its structure rather than rehashing the same information.

In relation to the story, it shows how the narrative can turn and twist, 
and how the gameplay could give the player options and choices within that scope.

You can use this format to not only inform your design document reader how you see your game unfold, 
but also as a concrete blueprint to design your game. 

It easily shows how cut-scene cinematics and gameplay work together to advance the overall story.

About Story Presentation Schemes

Telling your story is obviously important. 
How you tell that story through a game is illustrated in the  or Presentation Plan. 
This short, concise document outlines how your story unfolds in terms of gameplay, cinematics, intro movies, etc.

The following documents are part of a sample presentation scheme for StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty as I would write it to give you a sense of the general style of these documents. Since Wings of Liberty covers such a vast narrative, it’s important to keep this concise and give the reader a clear overview of your plans. With simpler games, you can follow the gameplay more closely, describing levels and/or missions with a little more narrative detail. There is no set formula or style to creating your own presentation scheme. Just remember the goal of this document is to convey how the story is laid out during gameplay.

Remember that we want to hit all 8 points in a synopsis, though they do not need to be in order.


Now, let's look at a synopsis for The Shooter. Try to identify each of the points laid out above.

About Setting Descriptions

Just as listing and describing your characters is important for a design document, so is presenting your settings and environments.

In these examples, we will take a closer look at the primary settings that we will include in our Game Design Document later.

By outlining these ideas and settings in written form, we'll learn how the game creator can aid the designers and give a better overview of the world to readers of the Game Design document.


Create your settings description briefs with the following points in mind:

Where are we?
What does this place have to do with the game story?
How does this place relate to the characters?
Where did we come from and where does this place lead?
What does this setting look like?


About Character Briefs

Understanding who your characters are is important to understanding your story and your game. In this lecture, we will take a closer look at the primary characters in StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty and break down their characters as exercise. Namely, we'll be making character lists and character briefs to describe who is in the story and what they do.

To create your character briefs keep the following six points in mind:


famine: bees going crazy with hunger, volcanoe erupts, 

consequences of your drought[edit][up down]
lack of water for irrigation
redunced dilution of pollutants

wildlife habitat damage: terrestrial, aquatic

Energy and power are often confused. 
Energy is the total amount of work done. 
Power is the rate at which that work is done. 
The standard unit of energy is the joule, 
equivalent to a power of 1 watt for 1 second 
(or one-tenth of a watt for 10 seconds, etc). T
the standard unit of power is the watt, 
equal to one joule of energy per second.

All buildings in the village of Severny (both wooden and brick), 
located 55 km (34 mi) from ground zero within the Sukhoy Nos test range, 
were destroyed. 

In districts hundreds of kilometers 
from ground zero wooden houses were destroyed, 
stone ones lost their roofs, windows, doors, 
and radio communications were interrupted for almost one hour. 

One participant in the test saw a bright flash through dark goggles 
and felt the effects of a thermal pulse even at a distance of 270 kilometres (170 mi). 
The heat from the explosion could have caused third-degree burns 100 km (62 mi) 
away from ground zero. 
A shock wave was observed in the air at Dikson settlement 700 km (430 mi) away; 
windowpanes were partially broken to distances of 900 kilometres (560 mi).
Atmospheric focusing caused blast damage at even greater distances, 
breaking windows in Norway and Finland. 

Despite being detonated 4.2 km above ground, 
its seismic body wave magnitude was estimated at 5–5.25.

Sensors continued to identify the shockwaves after their third trip around the world

A secondary unit of energy is the kilowatt-hour (kWh), 
the equivalent of 1,000 watts of power for 1 hour. 
It is equal to 3,600,000 joules.

So the literal answer to your question is "60 watts" in both cases. 
But the total energy consumed in 1 second will be 
60 joules or 0.000016666 kWh. 

The energy consumed in 1 hour will be 216,000 joules, 60 watt-hours, or 0.06 kWh.

Volcanic activity produces lightning-friendly conditions in multiple ways. The enormous quantity of pulverized material and gases explosively ejected into the atmosphere creates a dense plume of particles. The ash density and constant motion within the volcanic plume produces charge by frictional interactions (triboelectrification), resulting in very powerful and very frequent flashes as the cloud attempts to neutralize itself. Due to the extensive solid material (ash) content, unlike the water rich charge generating zones of a normal thundercloud, it is often called a dirty thunderstorm.
Powerful and frequent flashes have been witnessed in the volcanic plume as far back as the 79 AD eruption of Vesuvius by Pliny The Younger.[76]
Likewise, vapors and ash originating from vents on the volcano's flanks may produce more localized and smaller flashes upwards of 2.9 km long.
Small, short duration sparks, recently documented near newly extruded magma, 
attest to the material being highly charged prior to even entering the atmosphere.

Energy content[edit]
A common hardwood, red oak, has an energy content 
(Heat value) of 14.9 megajoules per kilogram (6,388 BTU per pound), 
and 10.4 megajoules recoverable if burned at 70% efficiency.[4]

The furthest reported distance record has been confirmed as a lightning bolt over Oklahoma in June 2007, 
which covered a horizontal distance of 321km (200 miles).

Firesnake:
A lightning bolt flashes on a summer night.
It sparks, sizzles, and spirals down a dead pine tree.
I awake.
And I breath. 
I am the fearsome Firesnake.
My infant form first takes shape as wisps of smoke rising from the once living bark.
A small glow of red flame pierces the black air like a gentle yellow buzz.
I can not stay small and safe for long.
It is not in my nature when I am born into evironments such as these.
A warm wind from the North helps my tiny flames grow. 
The bed of pine needles below moves quickly through the swamp.
When I find myself strong enough I shall climb anything and everything that will hold my invisible weight.
After much rising, my flames find finnally find the best of all juicy foods in the crowns of other pines.
The feast shapes parts of me into fireballs of exploding fury.
I can now dance from one tree to the next 
Birds and beast alike begin to notice me over head.
They will be my desert later.
My power becomes a falling wall of gaining speed
My roar greater than a thousand gators.  
Through out the Okeenokee swamp I will endless move untill done.
Yes I am a terrible creature with no mind to call my own and hunger none can escape.
I am a fickle beast too since even my direction with change without warning.
My path is full of death.
I kill all.
The swifest of animals maybe able to escape.
Those less lucky perish.
Unlike other forces, I can give my victims a few options.
Some are burned to death.
My favorites sufficate as they are robbed of oxygen.
Sometimes a dying bunny becomes my slave.
Its gentle beauty is no defense as its fur goes up in a hot blaze kissing all the dandilions and lemon grass around.
Watch it weakly jump maddingly through the woods spreading my message for a short while.
I will die too in time.
My ancient enemy is forever inside the same clouds holding the secert of my youth.
But untill that end I shall paint the swamp behind me darker than hour of midnight.
And laugh at the tree skeletons whisphered cries to the dead animals all around.


Analysis[edit]

Total destruction radius, superimposed on Paris
The Tsar Bomba is the single most physically powerful device ever deployed by mankind.[27] 
For comparison, the largest weapon ever produced by the U.S., 
the now-decommissioned B41, had a predicted maximum yield of 25 megatons of TNT (100 PJ). 
The largest nuclear device ever tested by the U.S. (Castle Bravo) yielded 15 megatons of TNT (63 PJ) 
because of an unexpectedly high involvement of lithium-7 in the fusion reaction; 
the preliminary prediction for the yield was from 4 to 6 megatons of TNT (17 to 25 PJ). 
The largest weapons deployed by the Soviet Union were also around 25 megatons of TNT (100 PJ) 
(e.g., the SS-18 Mod. 3 warhead).[citation needed]
The weight and size of the Tsar Bomba limited the range and 
speed of the specially modified bomber carrying it 
and ruled out its delivery by an intercontinental ballistic missile. 
Much of its high-yield destructiveness was inefficiently radiated upwards into space. 
It has been estimated that detonating the original 100 Mt design would have released fallout amounting 
to about 26% of all fallout emitted since the invention of nuclear weapons.
It was decided that a full 100 Mt detonation would create too great a risk of nuclear fallout, 
as well as a near certainty that the release plane (and crew) would be destroyed before 
it could escape the blast radius.
The Tsar Bomba was the culmination of a series of high-yield thermonuclear weapons
 designed by the Soviet Union and the United States during the 1950s 
 (e.g., the Mark 17[30] and B41 nuclear bombs).[citation needed]

A wildfire in California on September 5, 2008
A wildfire or wildland fire is a fire in an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area.[1] Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire.[2] Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago.[3] Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.[4] Earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich vegetation, seasonally dry climates, atmospheric oxygen, and widespread lightning and volcano ignitions.[4]
Wildfires can be characterized in terms of the cause of ignition, their physical properties, the combustible material present, and the effect of weather on the fire.[5] Wildfires can cause damage to property and human life, but they have many beneficial effects on native vegetation, animals, and ecosystems that have evolved with fire.[6][7] Many plant species depend on the effects of fire for growth and reproduction.[8] However, wildfire in ecosystems where wildfire is uncommon or where non-native vegetation has encroached may have negative ecological effects.[5] Wildfire behaviour and severity result from the combination of factors such as available fuels, physical setting, and weather.[9][10][11] Analyses of historical meteorological data and national fire records in western North America show the primacy of climate in driving large regional fires via wet periods that create substantial fuels or drought and warming that extend conducive fire weather.[12]
Strategies of wildfire prevention, detection, and suppression have varied over the years.[13] One common and inexpensive technique is controlled burning: permitting or even igniting smaller fires to minimize the amount of flammable material available for a potential wildfire.[14][15] Vegetation may be burned periodically to maintain high species diversity and frequent burning of surface fuels limits fuel accumulation.[16][17] Wildland fire use is the cheapest and most ecologically appropriate policy for many forests.[18] Fuels may also be removed by logging, but fuels treatments and thinning have no effect on severe fire behavior when under extreme weather conditions.[19] Wildfire itself is reportedly "the most effective treatment for reducing a fire's rate of spread, fireline intensity, flame length, and heat per unit of area" according to Jan Van Wagtendonk, a biologist at the Yellowstone Field Station.[20] Building codes in fire-prone areas typically require that structures be built of flame-resistant materials and a defensible space be maintained by clearing flammable materials within a prescribed distance from the structure.[21][22]

Four major natural causes of wildfire ignitions exist:[23][24]
lightning
sparks from rockfalls
spontaneous combustion
volcanic eruption
The most common direct human causes of wildfire ignition include arson, discarded cigarettes, power-line arcs (as detected by arc mapping), and sparks from equipment.[25][26] Ignition of wildland fires via contact with hot rifle-bullet fragments is also possible under the right conditions.[27] Wildfires can also be started in communities experiencing shifting cultivation, where land is cleared quickly and farmed until the soil loses fertility, and slash and burn clearing.[28] Forested areas cleared by logging encourage the dominance of flammable grasses, and abandoned logging roads overgrown by vegetation may act as fire corridors. Annual grassland fires in southern Vietnam stem in part from the destruction of forested areas by US military herbicides, explosives, and mechanical land-clearing and -burning operations during the Vietnam War.[29]
The most common cause of wildfires varies throughout the world. In Canada and northwest China, for example, lightning operates as the major source of ignition. In other parts of the world, human involvement is a major contributor. In Africa, Central America, Fiji, Mexico, New Zealand, South America, and Southeast Asia, wildfires can be attributed to human activities such as agriculture, animal husbandry, and land-conversion burning. In China and in the Mediterranean Basin, human carelessness is a major cause of wildfires. In the United States and Australia, the source of wildfires can be traced both to lightning strikes and to human activities (such as machinery sparks, cast-away cigarette butts, or arson)."[30] Coal seam fires burn in the thousands around the world, such as those in Burning Mountain, New South Wales; Centralia, Pennsylvania; and several coal-sustained fires in China. They can also flare up unexpectedly and ignite nearby flammable material.[31]
Spread[edit]

The spread of wildfires varies based on the flammable material present, its vertical arrangement and moisture content, and weather conditions.[32] Fuel arrangement and density is governed in part by topography, as land shape determines factors such as available sunlight and water for plant growth. Overall, fire types can be generally characterized by their fuels as follows:
Ground fires are fed by subterranean roots, duff and other buried organic matter. This fuel type is especially susceptible to ignition due to spotting. Ground fires typically burn by smoldering, and can burn slowly for days to months, such as peat fires in Kalimantan and Eastern Sumatra, Indonesia, which resulted from a riceland creation project that unintentionally drained and dried the peat.[33][34]
Crawling or surface fires are fueled by low-lying vegetation such as leaf and timber litter, debris, grass, and low-lying shrubbery.[35]
Ladder fires consume material between low-level vegetation and tree canopies, such as small trees, downed logs, and vines. Kudzu, Old World climbing fern, and other invasive plants that scale trees may also encourage ladder fires.[36]
Crown, canopy, or aerial fires burn suspended material at the canopy level, such as tall trees, vines, and mosses. The ignition of a crown fire, termed crowning, is dependent on the density of the suspended material, canopy height, canopy continuity, sufficient surface and ladder fires, vegetation moisture content, and weather conditions during the blaze.[37] Stand-replacing fires lit by humans can spread into the Amazon rain forest, damaging ecosystems not particularly suited for heat or arid conditions.[38]

Wildfires occur when all of the necessary elements of a fire triangle come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as vegetation, that is subjected to sufficient heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are required to evaporate any water within the material and heat the material to its fire point.[11][39] Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires.[40] Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks.[41] Plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain.[42] When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.[43][44]
A wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material.[45] As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 °C (212 °F). Next, the pyrolysis of wood at 230 °C (450 °F) releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at 380 °C (720 °F) or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590 °C (1,000 °F).[46][47] Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 °C (1,470 °F), which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster.[41][48] High-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from below.[49]
Wildfires have a rapid forward rate of spread (FROS) when burning through dense, uninterrupted fuels.[50] They can move as fast as 10.8 kilometres per hour (6.7 mph) in forests and 22 kilometres per hour (14 mph) in grasslands.[51] Wildfires can advance tangential to the main front to form a flanking front, or burn in the opposite direction of the main front by backing.[52] They may also spread by jumping or spotting as winds and vertical convection columns carry firebrands (hot wood embers) and other burning materials through the air over roads, rivers, and other barriers that may otherwise act as firebreaks.[53][54] Torching and fires in tree canopies encourage spotting, and dry ground fuels that surround a wildfire are especially vulnerable to ignition from firebrands.[55] Spotting can create spot fires as hot embers and firebrands ignite fuels downwind from the fire. In Australian bushfires, spot fires are known to occur as far as 20 kilometres (12 mi) from the fire front.[56]
Especially large wildfires may affect air currents in their immediate vicinities by the stack effect: air rises as it is heated, and large wildfires create powerful updrafts that will draw in new, cooler air from surrounding areas in thermal columns.[57] Great vertical differences in temperature and humidity encourage pyrocumulus clouds, strong winds, and fire whirls with the force of tornadoes at speeds of more than 80 kilometres per hour (50 mph).[58][59][60] Rapid rates of spread, prolific crowning or spotting, the presence of fire whirls, and strong convection columns signify extreme conditions.[61]
The thermal heat from wildfire can cause significant weathering of rocks and boulders, heat can rapidly expand a boulder and thermal shock can occur, which may cause an object's structure to fail.
Effect of weather[edit]

Lightning-sparked wildfires are frequent occurrences during the dry summer season in Nevada.

Heat waves, droughts, cyclical climate changes such as El Niño, and regional weather patterns such as high-pressure ridges can increase the risk and alter the behavior of wildfires dramatically.[62][63] Years of precipitation followed by warm periods can encourage more widespread fires and longer fire seasons.[64] Since the mid-1980s, earlier snowmelt and associated warming has also been associated with an increase in length and severity of the wildfire season in the Western United States.[65] Global warming may increase the intensity and frequency of droughts in many areas, creating more intense and frequent wildfires.[5] A 2015 study[66] indicates that the increase in fire risk in California may be attributable to human-induced climate change.[67] A study of alluvial sediment deposits going back over 8,000 years found warmer climate periods experienced severe droughts and stand-replacing fires and concluded climate was such a powerful influence on wildfire that trying to recreate presettlement forest structure is likely impossible in a warmer future.[68]
Intensity also increases during daytime hours. Burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day due to lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds.[69] Sunlight warms the ground during the day which creates air currents that travel uphill. At night the land cools, creating air currents that travel downhill. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys.[70] Fires in Europe occur frequently during the hours of 12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m.[71] Wildfire suppression operations in the United States revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. due to the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.[72]

Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.[4] Wildfires are common in climates that are sufficiently moist to allow the growth of vegetation but feature extended dry, hot periods.[8] Such places include the vegetated areas of Australia and Southeast Asia, the veld in southern Africa, the fynbos in the Western Cape of South Africa, the forested areas of the United States and Canada, and the Mediterranean Basin.
High-severity wildfire creates complex early seral forest habitat (also called “snag forest habitat”), which often has higher species richness and diversity than unburned old forest.[6] Plant and animal species in most types of North American forests evolved with fire, and many of these species depend on wildfires, and particularly high-severity fires, to reproduce and grow. Fire helps to return nutrients from plant matter back to soil, the heat from fire is necessary to the germination of certain types of seeds, and the snags (dead trees) and early successional forests created by high-severity fire create habitat conditions that are beneficial to wildlife.[6] Early successional forests created by high-severity fire support some of the highest levels of native biodiversity found in temperate conifer forests.[7][73] Post-fire logging has no ecological benefits and many negative impacts; the same is often true for post-fire seeding.[18]
Although some ecosystems rely on naturally occurring fires to regulate growth, some ecosystems suffer from too much fire, such as the chaparral in southern California and lower elevation deserts in the American Southwest. The increased fire frequency in these ordinarily fire-dependent areas has upset natural cycles, damaged native plant communities, and encouraged the growth of non-native weeds.[74][75][76][77] Invasive species, such as Lygodium microphyllum and Bromus tectorum, can grow rapidly in areas that were damaged by fires. Because they are highly flammable, they can increase the future risk of fire, creating a positive feedback loop that increases fire frequency and further alters native vegetation communities.[36][78]
In the Amazon Rainforest, drought, logging, cattle ranching practices, and slash-and-burn agriculture damage fire-resistant forests and promote the growth of flammable brush, creating a cycle that encourages more burning.[79] Fires in the rainforest threaten its collection of diverse species and produce large amounts of CO2.[80] Also, fires in the rainforest, along with drought and human involvement, could damage or destroy more than half of the Amazon rainforest by the year 2030.[81] Wildfires generate ash, destroy available organic nutrients, and cause an increase in water runoff, eroding away other nutrients and creating flash flood conditions.[32][82] A 2003 wildfire in the North Yorkshire Moors destroyed 2.5 square kilometers (600 acres) of heather and the underlying peat layers. Afterwards, wind erosion stripped the ash and the exposed soil, revealing archaeological remains dating back to 10,000 BC.[83] Wildfires can also have an effect on climate change, increasing the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere and inhibiting vegetation growth, which affects overall carbon uptake by plants.[84]
In tundra there is a natural pattern of accumulation of fuel and wildfire which varies depending on the nature of vegetation and terrain. Research in Alaska has shown fire-event return intervals, (FRIs) that typically vary from 150 to 200 years with dryer lowland areas burning more frequently than wetter upland areas.[85]
Plant adaptation[edit]

Plants in wildfire-prone ecosystems often survive through adaptations to their local fire regime. Such adaptations include physical protection against heat, increased growth after a fire event, and flammable materials that encourage fire and may eliminate competition. For example, plants of the genus Eucalyptus contain flammable oils that encourage fire and hard sclerophyll leaves to resist heat and drought, ensuring their dominance over less fire-tolerant species.[86][87] Dense bark, shedding lower branches, and high water content in external structures may also protect trees from rising temperatures.[8] Fire-resistant seeds and reserve shoots that sprout after a fire encourage species preservation, as embodied by pioneer species. Smoke, charred wood, and heat can stimulate the germination of seeds in a process called serotiny.[88] Exposure to smoke from burning plants promotes germination in other types of plants by inducing the production of the orange butenolide.[89]
Grasslands in Western Sabah, Malaysian pine forests, and Indonesian Casuarina forests are believed to have resulted from previous periods of fire.[90] Chamise deadwood litter is low in water content and flammable, and the shrub quickly sprouts after a fire.[8] Cape lilies lie dormant until flames brush away the covering, then blossom almost overnight.[91] Sequoia rely on periodic fires to reduce competition, release seeds from their cones, and clear the soil and canopy for new growth.[92] Caribbean Pine in Bahamian pineyards have adapted to and rely on low-intensity, surface fires for survival and growth. An optimum fire frequency for growth is every 3 to 10 years. Too frequent fires favor herbaceous plants, and infrequent fires favor species typical of Bahamian dry forests.[93]

Most of the Earth's weather and air pollution resides in the troposphere, the part of the atmosphere that extends from the surface of the planet to a height of about 10 kilometers (6 mi). The vertical lift of a severe thunderstorm or pyrocumulonimbus can be enhanced in the area of a large wildfire, which can propel smoke, soot, and other particulate matter as high as the lower stratosphere.[94] Previously, prevailing scientific theory held that most particles in the stratosphere came from volcanoes, but smoke and other wildfire emissions have been detected from the lower stratosphere.[95] Pyrocumulus clouds can reach 6,100 meters (20,000 ft) over wildfires.[96] Satellite observation of smoke plumes from wildfires revealed that the plumes could be traced intact for distances exceeding 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi).[97] Computer-aided models such as CALPUFF may help predict the size and direction of wildfire-generated smoke plumes by using atmospheric dispersion modeling.[98]
Wildfires can affect local atmospheric pollution,[99] and release carbon in the form of carbon dioxide.[100] Wildfire emissions contain fine particulate matter which can cause cardiovascular and respiratory problems.[101] Increased fire byproducts in the troposphere can increase ozone concentration beyond safe levels.[102] Forest fires in Indonesia in 1997 were estimated to have released between 0.81 and 2.57 gigatonnes (0.89 and 2.83 billion short tons) of CO2 into the atmosphere, which is between 13%–40% of the annual global carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels.[103][104] Atmospheric models suggest that these concentrations of sooty particles could increase absorption of incoming solar radiation during winter months by as much as 15%.[105]

History[edit]
Further information: Fossil record of fire
In the Welsh Borders, the first evidence of wildfire is rhyniophytoid plant fossils preserved as charcoal, dating to the Silurian period (about 420 million years ago). Smoldering surface fires started to occur sometime before the Early Devonian period 405 million years ago. Low atmospheric oxygen during the Middle and Late Devonian was accompanied by a decrease in charcoal abundance.[106][107] Additional charcoal evidence suggests that fires continued through the Carboniferous period. Later, the overall increase of atmospheric oxygen from 13% in the Late Devonian to 30-31% by the Late Permian was accompanied by a more widespread distribution of wildfires.[108] Later, a decrease in wildfire-related charcoal deposits from the late Permian to the Triassic periods is explained by a decrease in oxygen levels.[109]
Wildfires during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic periods followed patterns similar to fires that occur in modern times. Surface fires driven by dry seasons[clarification needed] are evident in Devonian and Carboniferous progymnosperm forests. Lepidodendron forests dating to the Carboniferous period have charred peaks, evidence of crown fires. In Jurassic gymnosperm forests, there is evidence of high frequency, light surface fires.[109] The increase of fire activity in the late Tertiary[110] is possibly due to the increase of C4-type grasses. As these grasses shifted to more mesic habitats, their high flammability increased fire frequency, promoting grasslands over woodlands.[111] However, fire-prone habitats may have contributed to the prominence of trees such as those of the genera Eucalyptus, Pinus and Sequoia, which have thick bark to withstand fires and employ serotiny.[112][113]
Human involvement[edit]

The human use of fire for agricultural and hunting purposes during the Paleolithic and Mesolithic ages altered the preexisting landscapes and fire regimes. Woodlands were gradually replaced by smaller vegetation that facilitated travel, hunting, seed-gathering and planting.[114] In recorded human history, minor allusions to wildfires were mentioned in the Bible and by classical writers such as Homer. However, while ancient Hebrew, Greek, and Roman writers were aware of fires, they were not very interested in the uncultivated lands where wildfires occurred.[115][116] Wildfires were used in battles throughout human history as early thermal weapons. From the Middle ages, accounts were written of occupational burning as well as customs and laws that governed the use of fire. In Germany, regular burning was documented in 1290 in the Odenwald and in 1344 in the Black Forest.[117] In the 14th century Sardinia, firebreaks were used for wildfire protection. In Spain during the 1550s, sheep husbandry was discouraged in certain provinces by Philip II due to the harmful effects of fires used in transhumance.[115][116] As early as the 17th century, Native Americans were observed using fire for many purposes including cultivation, signaling, and warfare. Scottish botanist David Douglas noted the native use of fire for tobacco cultivation, to encourage deer into smaller areas for hunting purposes, and to improve foraging for honey and grasshoppers. Charcoal found in sedimentary deposits off the Pacific coast of Central America suggests that more burning occurred in the 50 years before the Spanish colonization of the Americas than after the colonization.[118] In the post-World War II Baltic region, socio-economic changes led more stringent air quality standards and bans on fires that eliminated traditional burning practices.[117] In the mid-19th century, explorers from the HMS Beagle observed Australian Aborigines using fire for ground clearing, hunting, and regeneration of plant food in a method later named fire-stick farming.[119] Such careful use of fire has been employed for centuries in the lands protected by Kakadu National Park to encourage biodiversity.[120]
Wildfires typically occurred during periods of increased temperature and drought. An increase in fire-related debris flow in alluvial fans of northeastern Yellowstone National Park was linked to the period between AD 1050 and 1200, coinciding with the Medieval Warm Period.[121] However, human influence caused an increase in fire frequency. Dendrochronological fire scar data and charcoal layer data in Finland suggests that, while many fires occurred during severe drought conditions, an increase in the number of fires during 850 BC and 1660 AD can be attributed to human influence.[122] Charcoal evidence from the Americas suggested a general decrease in wildfires between 1 AD and 1750 compared to previous years. However, a period of increased fire frequency between 1750 and 1870 was suggested by charcoal data from North America and Asia, attributed to human population growth and influences such as land clearing practices. This period was followed by an overall decrease in burning in the 20th century, linked to the expansion of agriculture, increased livestock grazing, and fire prevention efforts.[123] A meta-analysis found that 17 times more land burned annually in California before 1800 compared to recent decades (1,800,000 hectares/year compared to 102,000 hectares/year).[124]
According to a paper published in Science, the number of natural and human-caused fires decreased by 24.3% between 1998 and 2015. Researchers explain this a transition from nomadism to settled lifestyle and intensification of agriculture that lead to a drop in the use of fire for land clearing.[125][126]
Invasive species moved by humans have in some cases increased the intensity of wildfires, such as Eucalyptus in California and gamba grass in Australia.
Prevention[edit]

Wildfire prevention refers to the preemptive methods aimed at reducing the risk of fires as well as lessening its severity and spread.[127] Prevention techniques aim to manage air quality, maintain ecological balances, protect resources,[78] and to affect future fires.[128] North American firefighting policies permit naturally caused fires to burn to maintain their ecological role, so long as the risks of escape into high-value areas are mitigated.[129] However, prevention policies must consider the role that humans play in wildfires, since, for example, 95% of forest fires in Europe are related to human involvement.[130] Sources of human-caused fire may include arson, accidental ignition, or the uncontrolled use of fire in land-clearing and agriculture such as the slash-and-burn farming in Southeast Asia.[131]
In 1937, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated a nationwide fire prevention campaign, highlighting the role of human carelessness in forest fires. Later posters of the program featured Uncle Sam, leaders of the Axis powers of World War II, characters from the Disney movie Bambi, and the official mascot of the U.S. Forest Service, Smokey Bear.[132] Reducing human-caused ignitions may be the most effective means of reducing unwanted wildfire. Alteration of fuels is commonly undertaken when attempting to affect future fire risk and behavior.[32] Wildfire prevention programs around the world may employ techniques such as wildland fire use and prescribed or controlled burns.[133][134] Wildland fire use refers to any fire of natural causes that is monitored but allowed to burn. Controlled burns are fires ignited by government agencies under less dangerous weather conditions.[135]

Vegetation may be burned periodically to maintain high species diversity and frequent burning of surface fuels limits fuel accumulation.[16][17] Wildland fire use is the cheapest and most ecologically appropriate policy for many forests.[18] Fuels may also be removed by logging, but fuels treatments and thinning have no effect on severe fire behavior[19] Wildfire models are often used to predict and compare the benefits of different fuel treatments on future wildfire spread, but their accuracy is low.[32]
Wildfire itself is reportedly "the most effective treatment for reducing a fire's rate of spread, fireline intensity, flame length, and heat per unit of area" according to Jan van Wagtendonk, a biologist at the Yellowstone Field Station.[20]
Building codes in fire-prone areas typically require that structures be built of flame-resistant materials and a defensible space be maintained by clearing flammable materials within a prescribed distance from the structure.[21][22] Communities in the Philippines also maintain fire lines 5 to 10 meters (16 to 33 ft) wide between the forest and their village, and patrol these lines during summer months or seasons of dry weather.[136] Continued residential development in fire-prone areas and rebuilding structures destroyed by fires has been met with criticism.[137] The ecological benefits of fire are often overridden by the economic and safety benefits of protecting structures and human life.[138]
US wildfire policy[edit]

History of wildfire policy in the U.S.[edit]
Since the turn of the 20th century, various federal and state agencies have been involved in wildland fire management in one form or another. In the early 20th century, for example, the federal government, through the U.S. Army and the U.S. Forest Service, solicited fire suppression as a primary goal of managing the nation's forests. At this time in history fire was viewed as a threat to timber, an economically important natural resource. As such, the decision was made to devote public funds to fire suppression and fire prevention efforts. For example, the Forest Fire Emergency Fund Act of 1908 permitted deficit spending in the case of emergency fire situations.[139] As a result, the U.S. Forest Service was able to acquire a deficit of over $1 million in 1910 due to emergency fire suppression efforts.[139] Following the same tone of timber resource protection, the U.S. Forest Service adopted the "10 AM Policy" in 1935.[139] Through this policy, the agency advocated the control of all fires by 10 o'clock of the morning following the discovery of a wildfire. Fire prevention was also heavily advocated through public education campaigns such as Smokey Bear. Through these and similar public education campaigns the general public was, in a sense, trained to perceive all wildfire as a threat to civilized society and natural resources. The negative sentiment towards wildland fire prevailed and helped to shape wildland fire management objectives throughout most of the 20th century.

Texas was particularly hard-hit by wildfires in 2011, as noted by this placard at the state Forestry Museum in Lufkin.
Beginning in the 1970s public perception of wildland fire management began to shift.[139] Despite strong funding for fire suppression in the first half of the 20th century, massive wildfires continued to be prevalent across the landscape of North America. Ecologists were beginning to recognize the presence and ecological importance of natural, lightning-ignited wildfires across the United States. It was learned that suppression of fire in certain ecosystems may in fact increase the likelihood that a wildfire will occur and may increase the intensity of those wildfires. With the emergence of fire ecology as a science also came an effort to apply fire to ecosystems in a controlled manner; however, suppression is still the main tactic when a fire is set by a human or if it threatens life or property.[140] By the 1980s, in light of this new understanding, funding efforts began to support prescribed burning in order to prevent wildfire events.[139] In 2001, the United States implemented a National Fire Plan, increasing the budget for the reduction of hazardous fuels from $108 million in 2000 to $401 million.[140]
In addition to using prescribed fire to reduce the chance of catastrophic wildfires, mechanical methods have recently been adopted as well. Mechanical methods include the use of chippers and other machinery to remove hazardous fuels and thereby reduce the risk of wildfire events. Today the United States' maintains that, "fire, as a critical natural process, will be integrated into land and resource management plans and activities on a landscape scale, and across agency boundaries. Response to wildfire is based on ecological, social and legal consequences of fire. The circumstance under which a fire occurs, and the likely consequences and public safety and welfare, natural and cultural resources, and values to be protected dictate the appropriate management response to fire" (United States Department of Agriculture Guidance for Implementation of Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy, 13 February 2009). The five federal regulatory agencies managing forest fire response and planning for 676 million acres in the United States are the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service, the United States Department of Agriculture-Forest Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Services. Several hundred million U.S. acres of wildfire management are also conducted by state, county, and local fire management organizations.[141] In 2014, legislators proposed The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act to provide $2.7 billion fund appropriated by congress for the USDA and Department of Interior to use in fire suppression. The bill is a reaction to United States Forest Service and Department of Interior costs of Western Wildfire suppression appending that amounted to $3.5 billion in 2013.[142]
Wildland-urban interface policy[edit]
See also: Wildland–urban interface and fire-adapted communities
An aspect of wildfire policy that is gaining attention is the wildland-urban interface (WUI). More and more people are living in "red zones," or areas that are at high risk of wildfires. FEMA and the NFPA develop specific policies to guide homeowners and builders in how to build and maintain structures at the WUI and how protect against property losses. For example, NFPA-1141 is a standard for fire protection infrastructure for land development in wildland, rural and suburban areas[143] and NFPA-1144 is a standard for reducing structure ignition hazards from wildland fire.[144] For a full list of these policies and guidelines, see http://www.nfpa.org/categoryList.asp?categoryID=124&URL=Codes%20&%20Standards. Compensation for losses in the WUI are typically negotiated on an incident-by-incident basis. This is generating discussion about the burden of responsibility for funding and fighting a fire in the WUI, in that, if a resident chooses to live in a known red zone, should he or she retain a higher level of responsibility for funding home protection against wildfires. One initiative aimed at helping U.S. WUI communities live more safely with fire is called fire-adapted communities.
Economics of fire management policy[edit]
Similar to that of military operations, fire management is often very expensive in the U.S. and the rest of the world. Today, it is not uncommon for suppression operations for a single wildfire to exceed costs of $1 million in just a few days. The United States Department of Agriculture allotted $2.2 billion for wildfire management in 2012.[145] Although fire suppression purports to benefit society, other options for fire management exist. While these options cannot completely replace fire suppression as a fire management tool, other options can play an important role in overall fire management and can therefore affect the costs of fire suppression.
Fire suppression and climate change has resulted in larger, more intense wildfire events which are seen today.[146] In economic terms, expenditures used for wildfire suppression in the early 20th century have contributed to increased suppression costs which are being realized today.[146]
Detection[edit]

Fast and effective detection is a key factor in wildfire fighting.[147] Early detection efforts were focused on early response, accurate results in both daytime and nighttime, and the ability to prioritize fire danger.[148] Fire lookout towers were used in the United States in the early 20th century and fires were reported using telephones, carrier pigeons, and heliographs.[149] Aerial and land photography using instant cameras were used in the 1950s until infrared scanning was developed for fire detection in the 1960s. However, information analysis and delivery was often delayed by limitations in communication technology. Early satellite-derived fire analyses were hand-drawn on maps at a remote site and sent via overnight mail to the fire manager. During the Yellowstone fires of 1988, a data station was established in West Yellowstone, permitting the delivery of satellite-based fire information in approximately four hours.[148]
Currently, public hotlines, fire lookouts in towers, and ground and aerial patrols can be used as a means of early detection of forest fires. However, accurate human observation may be limited by operator fatigue, time of day, time of year, and geographic location. Electronic systems have gained popularity in recent years as a possible resolution to human operator error. A government report on a recent trial of three automated camera fire detection systems in Australia did, however, conclude "...detection by the camera systems was slower and less reliable than by a trained human observer". These systems may be semi- or fully automated and employ systems based on the risk area and degree of human presence, as suggested by GIS data analyses. An integrated approach of multiple systems can be used to merge satellite data, aerial imagery, and personnel position via Global Positioning System (GPS) into a collective whole for near-realtime use by wireless Incident Command Centers.[150][151]
A small, high risk area that features thick vegetation, a strong human presence, or is close to a critical urban area can be monitored using a local sensor network. Detection systems may include wireless sensor networks that act as automated weather systems: detecting temperature, humidity, and smoke.[152][153][154][155] These may be battery-powered, solar-powered, or tree-rechargeable: able to recharge their battery systems using the small electrical currents in plant material.[156] Larger, medium-risk areas can be monitored by scanning towers that incorporate fixed cameras and sensors to detect smoke or additional factors such as the infrared signature of carbon dioxide produced by fires. Additional capabilities such as night vision, brightness detection, and color change detection may also be incorporated into sensor arrays.[157][158][159]

Satellite and aerial monitoring through the use of planes, helicopter, or UAVs can provide a wider view and may be sufficient to monitor very large, low risk areas. These more sophisticated systems employ GPS and aircraft-mounted infrared or high-resolution visible cameras to identify and target wildfires.[160][161] Satellite-mounted sensors such as Envisat's Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer and European Remote-Sensing Satellite's Along-Track Scanning Radiometer can measure infrared radiation emitted by fires, identifying hot spots greater than 39 °C (102 °F).[162][163] The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hazard Mapping System combines remote-sensing data from satellite sources such as Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) for detection of fire and smoke plume locations.[164][165] However, satellite detection is prone to offset errors, anywhere from 2 to 3 kilometers (1 to 2 mi) for MODIS and AVHRR data and up to 12 kilometers (7.5 mi) for GOES data.[166] Satellites in geostationary orbits may become disabled, and satellites in polar orbits are often limited by their short window of observation time. Cloud cover and image resolution and may also limit the effectiveness of satellite imagery.[167]
in 2015 a new fire detection tool is in operation at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (USFS) which uses data from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite to detect smaller fires in more detail than previous space-based products. The high-resolution data is used with a computer model to predict how a fire will change direction based on weather and land conditions. The active fire detection product using data from Suomi NPP's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) increases the resolution of fire observations to 1,230 feet (375 meters). Previous NASA satellite data products available since the early 2000s observed fires at 3,280 foot (1 kilometer) resolution. The data is one of the intelligence tools used by the USFS and Department of Interior agencies across the United States to guide resource allocation and strategic fire management decisions. The enhanced VIIRS fire product enables detection every 12 hours or less of much smaller fires and provides more detail and consistent tracking of fire lines during long duration wildfires – capabilities critical for early warning systems and support of routine mapping of fire progression. Active fire locations are available to users within minutes from the satellite overpass through data processing facilities at the USFS Remote Sensing Applications Center, which uses technologies developed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Direct Readout Laboratory in Greenbelt, Maryland. The model uses data on weather conditions and the land surrounding an active fire to predict 12–18 hours in advance whether a blaze will shift direction. The state of Colorado decided to incorporate the weather-fire model in its firefighting efforts beginning with the 2016 fire season.
In 2014, an international campaign was organized in South Africa's Kruger National Park to validate fire detection products including the new VIIRS active fire data. In advance of that campaign, the Meraka Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Pretoria, South Africa, an early adopter of the VIIRS 375m fire product, put it to use during several large wildfires in Kruger.
The demand for timely, high-quality fire information has increased in recent years. Wildfires in the United States burn an average of 7 million acres of land each year. For the last 10 years, the USFS and Department of Interior have spent a combined average of about $2–4 billion annually on wildfire suppression.
Suppression[edit]
Main article: Wildfire suppression
See also: Firefighting

Wildfire suppression depends on the technologies available in the area in which the wildfire occurs. In less developed nations the techniques used can be as simple as throwing sand or beating the fire with sticks or palm fronds.[168] In more advanced nations, the suppression methods vary due to increased technological capacity. Silver iodide can be used to encourage snow fall,[169] while fire retardants and water can be dropped onto fires by unmanned aerial vehicles, planes, and helicopters.[170][171] Complete fire suppression is no longer an expectation, but the majority of wildfires are often extinguished before they grow out of control. While more than 99% of the 10,000 new wildfires each year are contained, escaped wildfires under extreme weather conditions are difficult to suppress without a change in the weather. Wildfires in Canada and the US burn an average of 54,500 square kilometers (13,000,000 acres) per year.[172][173]
Above all, fighting wildfires can become deadly. A wildfire's burning front may also change direction unexpectedly and jump across fire breaks. Intense heat and smoke can lead to disorientation and loss of appreciation of the direction of the fire, which can make fires particularly dangerous. For example, during the 1949 Mann Gulch fire in Montana, USA, thirteen smokejumpers died when they lost their communication links, became disoriented, and were overtaken by the fire.[174] In the Australian February 2009 Victorian bushfires, at least 173 people died and over 2,029 homes and 3,500 structures were lost when they became engulfed by wildfire.[175]
Costs of wildfire suppression[edit]
In California, the U.S. Forest Service spends about $200 million per year to suppress 98% of wildfires and up to $1 billion to suppress the other 2% of fires that escape initial attack and become large.[176]
Wildland firefighting safety[edit]

Wildland fire fighters face several life-threatening hazards including heat stress, fatigue, smoke and dust, as well as the risk of other injuries such as burns, cuts and scrapes, animal bites, and even rhabdomyolysis.[177][178]
Especially in hot weather condition, fires present the risk of heat stress, which can entail feeling heat, fatigue, weakness, vertigo, headache, or nausea. Heat stress can progress into heat strain, which entails physiological changes such as increased heart rate and core body temperature. This can lead to heat-related illnesses, such as heat rash, cramps, exhaustion or heat stroke. Various factors can contribute to the risks posed by heat stress, including strenuous work, personal risk factors such as age and fitness, dehydration, sleep deprivation, and burdensome personal protective equipment. Rest, cool water, and occasional breaks are crucial to mitigating the effects of heat stress.[177]
Smoke, ash, and debris can also pose serious respiratory hazards to wildland fire fighters. The smoke and dust from wildfires can contain gases such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and formaldehyde, as well as particulates such as ash and silica. To reduce smoke exposure, wildfire fighting crews should, whenever possible, rotate firefighters through areas of heavy smoke, avoid downwind firefighting, use equipment rather than people in holding areas, and minimize mop-up. Camps and command posts should also be located upwind of wildfires. Protective clothing and equipment can also help minimize exposure to smoke and ash.[177]
Firefighters are also at risk of cardiac events including strokes and heart attacks. Fire fighters should maintain good physical fitness. Fitness programs, medical screening and examination programs which include stress tests can minimize the risks of firefighting cardiac problems.[177] Other injury hazards wildland fire fighters face include slips, trips and falls, burns, scrapes and cuts from tools and equipment, being struck by trees, vehicles, or other objects, plant hazards such as thorns and poison ivy, snake and animal bites, vehicle crashes, electrocution from power lines or lightning storms, and unstable building structures.[177]
Fire retardant[edit]
Fire retardants are used to help slow wildfires, coat fuels, and lessen oxygen availability as required by various firefighting situations.[179] They are composed of nitrates, ammonia, phosphates and sulfates, as well as other chemicals and thickening agents.[180] The choice of whether to apply retardant depends on the magnitude, location and intensity of the wildfire.[179] Fire retardants are used to reach inaccessible geographical regions where ground firefighting crews are unable to reach a wildfire or in any occasion where human safety and structures are endangered.[179] In certain instances, fire retardant may also be applied ahead of wildfires for protection of structures and vegetation as a precautionary fire defense measure.[181]
The application of aerial fire retardants creates an atypical appearance on land and water surfaces and has the potential to change soil chemistry.[179] Fire retardant can decrease the availability of plant nutrients in the soil by increasing the acidity of the soil.[179] Fire retardant may also affect water quality through leaching, eutrophication, or misapplication.[179] Fire retardant's effects on drinking water remain inconclusive.[182] Dilution factors, including water body size, rainfall, and water flow rates lessen the concentration and potency of fire retardant.[179][181] Wildfire debris (ash and sediment) clog rivers and reservoirs increasing the risk for floods and erosion that ultimately slow and/or damage water treatment systems.[182][183] There is continued concern of fire retardant effects on land, water, wildlife habitats, and watershed quality, additional research is needed. However, on the positive side, fire retardant (specifically its nitrogen and phosphorus components) has been shown to have a fertilizing effect on nutrient-deprived soils and thus creates a temporary increase in vegetation.[179][181]
Current USDA procedure maintains that the aerial application of fire retardant in the United States must clear waterways by a minimum of 300 feet in order to safeguard effects of retardant runoff.[179] Aerial uses of fire retardant are required to avoid application near waterways and endangered species (plant and animal habitats).[179] After any incident of fire retardant misapplication, the U.S. Forest Service requires reporting and assessment impacts be made in order to determine mitigation, remediation, and/or restrictions on future retardant uses in that area.[179]
Modeling[edit]
Main article: Wildfire modeling
A dark region shaped like a shield with a pointed bottom. An arrow and the text "propagation axis (wind)" indicates a bottom-to-top direction up the body of the shield shape. The shape's pointed bottom is labeled "fire start". Around the shield shape's top and thinning towards its sides, a yellow-orange region is labeled "left front", "right front", and (at the top) "head of the fire".
Fire Propagation Model
Wildfire modeling is concerned with numerical simulation of wildfires in order to comprehend and predict fire behavior.[184][185] Wildfire modeling aims to aid wildfire suppression, increase the safety of firefighters and the public, and minimize damage. Using computational science, wildfire modeling involves the statistical analysis of past fire events to predict spotting risks and front behavior. Various wildfire propagation models have been proposed in the past, including simple ellipses and egg- and fan-shaped models. Early attempts to determine wildfire behavior assumed terrain and vegetation uniformity. However, the exact behavior of a wildfire's front is dependent on a variety of factors, including windspeed and slope steepness. Modern growth models utilize a combination of past ellipsoidal descriptions and Huygens' Principle to simulate fire growth as a continuously expanding polygon.[186][187] Extreme value theory may also be used to predict the size of large wildfires. However, large fires that exceed suppression capabilities are often regarded as statistical outliers in standard analyses, even though fire policies are more influenced by large wildfires than by small fires.[188]

Human risk and exposure[edit]

2009 California Wildfires at NASA/JPL – Pasadena, California
Wildfire risk is the chance that a wildfire will start in or reach a particular area and the potential loss of human values if it does. Risk is dependent on variable factors such as human activities, weather patterns, availability of wildfire fuels, and the availability or lack of resources to suppress a fire.[189] Wildfires have continually been a threat to human populations. However, human induced geographical and climatic changes are exposing populations more frequently to wildfires and increasing wildfire risk. It is speculated that the increase in wildfires arises from a century of wildfire suppression coupled with the rapid expansion of human developments into fire-prone wildlands.[190] Wildfires are naturally occurring events that aid in promoting forest health. Global warming and climate changes are causing an increase in temperatures and more droughts nationwide which contributes to an increase in wildfire risk.[191][192]
Regional burden of wildfires in the United States[edit]

This map depicts regional burden to wildfires in the US from 1980–2014. These are categorized by "fire weather zone" as defined by the National Weather Service.
Nationally, the burden of wildfires is disproportionally heavily distributed in the southern and western regions. The Geographic Area Coordinating Group (GACG)[193] divides the United States and Alaska into 11 geographic areas for the purpose of emergency incident management. One particular area of focus is wildland fires. A national assessment of wildfire risk in the United States based on GACG identified regions (with the slight modification of combining Southern and Northern California, and the West and East Basin); indicate that California (50.22% risk) and the Southern Area (15.53% risk) are the geographic areas with the highest wildfire risk.[194] The western areas of the nation are experiencing an expansion of human development into and beyond what is called the wildland-urban interface (WUI). When wildfires inevitably occur in these fire-prone areas, often communities are threatened due to their proximity to fire-prone forest.[195] The south is one of the fastest growing regions with 88 million acres classified as WUI. The south consistently has the highest number of wildfires per year. More than 50, 000 communities are estimated to be at high to very high risk of wildfire damage. These statistics are greatly attributable to the South's year-round fire season.[196]
Chemical hazards[edit]
The most noticeable adverse effect of wildfires is the destruction of property. However, the release of hazardous chemicals from the burning of wildland fuels also significantly impacts health in humans.
Wildfire smoke is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and water vapor. Other common smoke components present in lower concentrations are carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, acrolein, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and benzene.[197] Small particulates suspended in air which come in solid form or in liquid droplets are also present in smoke. 80 -90% of wildfire smoke, by mass, is within the fine particle size class of 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller.[198]
Despite carbon dioxide's high concentration in smoke, it poses a low health risk due to its low toxicity. Rather, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter, particularly 2.5 µm in diameter and smaller, have been identified as the major health threats.[197] Other chemicals are considered to be significant hazards but are found in concentrations that are too low to cause detectable health effects.
The degree of wildfire smoke exposure to an individual is dependent on the length, severity, duration, and proximity of the fire. People are exposed directly to smoke via the respiratory tract though inhalation of air pollutants. Indirectly, communities are exposed to wildfire debris that can contaminate soil and water supplies.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed the Air Quality Index (AQI), a public resource that provides national air quality standard concentrations for common air pollutants. The public can use this index as a tool to determine their exposure to hazardous air pollutants based on visibility range.[199]
Groups at risk[edit]
Firefighters are at the greatest risk for acute and chronic health effects resulting from wildfire smoke exposure. Due to firefighters' occupational duties, they are frequently exposed to hazardous chemicals at a close proximity for longer periods of time. A case study on the exposure of wildfire smoke among wildland firefighters shows that firefighters are exposed to significant levels of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants above OSHA-permissible exposure limits (PEL) and ACGIH threshold limit values (TLV). 5–10% are overexposed. The study obtained exposure concentrations for one wildland firefighter over a 10-hour shift spent holding down a fireline. The firefighter was exposed to a wide range of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritant (combination of particulate matter 3.5 µm and smaller, acrolein, and formaldehype) levels. Carbon monoxide levels reached up to 160ppm and the TLV irritant index value reached a high of 10. In contrast, the OSHA PEL for carbon monoxide is 30ppm and for the TLV respiratory irritant index, the calculated threshold limit value is 1; any value above 1 exceeds exposure limits.[200]
Between 2001 and 2012, over 200 fatalities occurred among wildland firefighters. In addition to heat and chemical hazards, firefighters are also at risk for electrocution from power lines; injuries from equipment; slips, trips, and falls; injuries from vehicle rollovers; heat-related illness; insect bites and stings; stress; and rhabdomyolysis.[201]
Residents in communities surrounding wildfires are exposed to lower concentrations of chemicals, but they are at a greater risk for indirect exposure through water or soil contamination. Exposure to residents is greatly dependent on individual susceptibility. Vulnerable persons such as children (ages 0–4), the elderly (ages 65 and older), smokers, and pregnant women are at an increased risk due to their already compromised body systems, even when the exposures are present at low chemical concentrations and for relatively short exposure periods.[197]
Additionally, there is evidence of an increase in material stress, as documented by researchers M.H. O'Donnell and A.M. Behie, thus affecting birth outcomes. In Australia, studies show that male infants born with drastically higher average birth weights were born in mostly severely fire-affected areas. This is attributed to the fact that maternal signals directly affect fetal growth patterns.[202][203]

Thursday, February 16, 2017 Here we present a number of particularly weird and
bizarre ways that people have died. Though there are countless ways death can
occur, for this discussion the focus is on rare and unusual cases. With that in
mind This post has collected a handful of some of the strangest ways people have
died.


 1. The first strange death covered is Spontaneous Human Combustion. In these
    cases, it is reported that a person burst into flames without any obvious
    source of ignition or fuel. All that is left of these people are a pile of
    ashes where their bodies last lay.
 2. Next comes the strange case of dancing mania, specifically the Dancing
    Plague of 1518. In this bizarre event, hundreds of people suddenly and
    without any reason began to dance non stop out in the streets for days at a
    time. Some of these people literally danced to their own death, grooving
    until their bodies could not function any longer.
 3. Another case of strange deaths occurred on two separate occasions, when
    disasters involving food products caused the drowning deaths of numerous
    people. The Boston Molasses Disaster and the London Beer Flood are two of
    the only instances in which groups of unfortunate people were swept up in a
    spreading wave of something normally edible and ended up drowning.
 4. Franz Reichelt steps up next with his own unique and strange death. Franz
    was an inventor at heart and worked hard to create a working parachute suit
    pilots could wear. Unfortunately his tests jumps were not successful.
    Adamant to prove the worth of his invention, Franz decided to test his own
    design by jumping off the Eiffel Tower to display the effectiveness of his
    parachute… Things didn’t quite go as planned however, as Franz would not be
    remembered by his ingenious invention, but rather for his foolish death.
 5. The last, and perhaps strangest, topic is a rare mental disorder known as
    Cotard Delusion, also called Walking Corpse Syndrome. This illness describes
    an afflicted person who actually believes that they are already dead. Though
    extremely uncommon, this mental condition has lead several living people to
    unfortunately meet their own demise as they refuse to take care of their
    bodies, since in their own mind they are already dead.

Monday, November 26, 2012 WAYS TO DIE #100 - #104

#100 TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING – WATER INTOXICATION
In June of 2007 Jennifer Lea Strange joined a short list of people who drank
themselves to death with water when she fatally consumed an overdose of H2O
during a radio contest called “Hold Your Wee for a Wii”. The young wife and
mother agreed to drink as much water as possible as part of the contest in order
to win a Wii game player for her family. Contestants competed to see who could
go the longest without stopping to urinate. After the contest Strange collapsed
and died resulting in a civil lawsuit against the radio station. Water
intoxication which is also known as hyper-hydration can cause a fatal
disturbance in the brain when the electrolytes in the body are thrown off their
normal balance. Other famous deaths from water intoxication include artist Andy
Warhol whose family claimed he was given too many fluids following gallbladder
surgery in 1987.

#101 JUMPING INTO A VOLCANO
In 430 BC Empedocles a Greek philosopher who is best known being the originator
of the cosmogenic theory of the four classic elements threw himself into the
very active Mount Etna either to convince his followers, he was a god, or
because he believed himself to be immortal. He might also have thought he would
be reincarnated. The volcano put a quick end to any more hypotheses on his part.

#102 LAUGHTER ISN’T ALWAYS THE BEST MEDICINE
In 1599 when Burman king Nanda Bayin was informed by a visiting Italian merchant
that Venice was without a king and therefore a free state he started to laugh.
Unfortunately, for him he couldn’t stop laughing. His death was more than likely
a result of brain hemorrhage brought on by the strain of his giggle fit. Thomas
Urguhart a Scottish aristocrat and diplomat is said to have died in the same
manner in 1660 after hearing that Charles II had been made king.

#103 WHAT A WAY TO GO – DEATH BY OVEREATING
After drinking champagne and consuming a meal of lobster, smoked herring,
caviar, sauerkraut, and over a dozen servings of a favorite dessert Swedish king
Adolf Frederick understandably complained he didn’t feel well. He died a few
hours later. Sadly, Adolf’s favorite pastimes as ruler had been to make snuff
boxes and not much else. He’s therefore remembered only as “the king who ate
himself to death” in his own homeland.

#104 A GREAT DEMONSTRATION – LAWYER PROVES HIS CASE BY KILLING HIMSELF
In 1871 while representing a defendant in a murder case lawyer Clement
Vallandigham a United States Congressman and one time political opponent of
Abraham Lincoln wanted to prove the supposed murder weapon could have
accidentally been fired by the victim. Taking the gun from evidence Vallandigham
tried to demonstrate to the jury how the victim might have shot himself. His
mistake was in not checking to see if the gun was loaded. Just as Vallandigham
had speculated the firearm discharged and just as he’d conjectured the result
was a mortal wound. On an upbeat note at least the defendant was acquitted.

Thursday, August 9, 2012 WAYS TO DIE: #89 - #99
[HTTP://1001WAYSTODIE.BLOGSPOT.COM/2012/08/WAYS-TO-DIE-89-99.HTML]

89. Insane fit of laughter

Several historical figures deserve mention. The Stoic philosopher Chrysippus
reportedly got his donkey drunk and then died laughing at its attempts to eat
figs. Italian playwright and satirist Pietro Aretino apparently suffocated due
to excessive mirth, and Scottish aristocrat Thomas Urquhart chuckled himself
into oblivion upon hearing that Charles II had taken the throne.

An interesting modern-day case is that of Alex Mitchell (snopes.com), an English
bricklayer. On March 24, 1975, Mitchell laughed for 25 straight minutes after
watching an episode of The Goodies entitled “Kung Fu Kapers.” His widow later
thanked the program for providing her husband with such a delightful death
experience. image source: http://www.juhaszillustration.com/

90. Throwing yourself at a window to show how strong the glass is(n’t)

You are on the twenty-fourth floor. You probably shouldn’t try to prove how
strong that window is by charging up to it and throwing your body against it.
Because then the group of colleagues observing your demonstration might become
horrified witnesses of your untimely death.

Introducing Garry Hoy (Snopes.com), a Toronto lawyer who pulled that stunt on
July 9, 1993. Apparently, Mr. Hoy had performed the same feat in the past
without incident – he always just bounced right off the glass as the onlookers
chuckled and glanced at each other nervously.

His final demonstration certainly made an impact, although it wasn’t the kind of
impact he was hoping for. This time, when Hoy’s accelerating body struck the
glass, it popped out of the frame and Hoy fell to his death. This unfortunate
event was partly responsible for the closing of Holden Day Wilson, the lawyer
firm he worked for.

92. Your husband’s coffin

When you’re on your way to bury your dead husband, you probably don’t think
death will be striking again anytime soon. But such was life for a Brazilian
woman named Marciana Silva Barcelos.

On November 10, 2008, a funeral procession was on its way to a cemetery in
Alvorada. Barcelos, 67, was a passenger in the hearse carrying the body of her
husband, Josi Silveira Coimbra, who had died the day before. Suddenly, a
speeding car struck the back of the hearse. Dislodged by the accident, Josi’s
coffin hurtled forward and smashed into the back of Marciana’s neck, killing her
instantly (MSNBC Article).

So what do you do when something like that happens? Tell the gravediggers to
start another hole when they finish Josi’s?

93. Elevator

They’re supposed to save you time and energy that would otherwise be devoted to
actually using stairs. They aren’t supposed to kill you. But accidents happen.
In fact, a 2006 Center for Construction Research and Training report indicates
that about 30 people are killed in the U.S. every year by elevators and
escalators, and thousands more are injured.

For example, take the sad case of Dr. Hitoshi Nikaidoh, a doctor at Christus St.
Joseph Hospital in Houston, TX. As he was stepping into a hospital elevator one
Saturday morning, the doors closed too early and pinned his shoulders. The
safety system that prevents elevator doors from trapping passengers failed, and
as the elevator ascended, Dr. Nikaidoh’s body went one way and his head went the
other (Houston Press).

94. Sex

Wait, I thought sex was supposed to be fun, you say. It can kill you?

Yes. Just ask Sergey Tuganov, a 28-year-old Russian who suffered a severe case
of death after betting two women he could have sex with them for 12 straight
hours. He won the $4,300 bet and then promptly died. Doctors determined that his
death was caused by the entire bottle of Viagra pills he ingested before
attempting the feat of sexual endurance. At least the last 12 hours of his life
were happy hours. (Fox News)

You could also ask Kenneth Pinyon. He died from injuries suffered while… umm…
having anal sex with an Arabian stallion. Pinyon regularly engaged in bestiality
and had his performances videotaped and distributed under the name “Mr. Hands.”
On July 2, 2005, however, Mr. Hands made love to one last horse before
succumbing to “acute peritonitis due to perforation of the colon.” Translation:
Mr. Butt couldn’t take Mr. You-Know-What. (Wikipedia)

There are some other sick sex-death stories out there, too. Be careful. Having
sex could be the last thing you ever do.

95. Video games

They’re supposed to be fun and entertaining, but seriously people. There’s a
time to take a break from the video games. And that time is before they kill
you.

In 1981, a 19-year-old gamer named Jeff Dailey became the first official video
game victim. After racking up an impressive 16,660 points while playing the game
“Berzerk,” Jeff toppled over and died of a heart attack.(Gamespy)

Want more?

Less than two years later, 18-year-old Peter Burkowski also died of a heart
attack while playing the same game.

Want even more?

August 2005 – South Korean Lee Seung Seop died of exhaustion after playing
Starcraft online for 50 hours straight in an Internet café.

January 2007 – A 28-year-old woman named Jennifer Strange died of hyponatremia
(water intoxication) after participating in a contest at a local radio station.
In order to win a Nintendo Wii, the contestants competed to see who could drink
the most water without taking a potty break. Strange ingested enough water to
severely dilute the sodium levels in her bloodstream and bring about her death.

96. Floods – but not the water kind

Molasses Flood
Usually when we hear “flood” we think “water,” and usually we are right to think
this. However, there are at least two famous flood incidents that had nothing at
all to do with water.

The London Beer Flood, October 1814 – nine people died after a 22-foot high,
130,000-gallon vat of porter burst at the Meux & Co. Brewery. The enormous
volume of beer caused other vats to rupture as well, and more than 300,000
gallons of beer smashed its way through brick walls and blasted into the slums
of St. Giles, a London parish. The sound of the explosion was reportedly heard
up to five miles away. (BBC Article)

You can imagine the reaction of Londoners who weren’t immediately overwhelmed by
a beer tsunami. Yes, exactly what you would have done – run outside with pots,
pans, and anything else that can hold beer. Drink as much as possible, save the
rest. (Technically speaking, only eight of the nine casualties were because of
the actual flood. The ninth guy died from alcohol poisoning a few days later!)

The Boston Molasses Disaster, January 1919 – 21 people expired when a 50-foot
high storage tank full of molasses exploded and unleashed a crazy wave of sticky
death through Boston’s North End. (Bizarre Tragedies) The warm weather
apparently helped build pressure inside the poorly-constructed tank, eventually
causing an explosion. Several city blocks were flooded, and the wave was high
and strong enough to lift a freaking train off the Elevated Railway tracks.

They say it still smells like molasses there on hot summer days.

97. Your own wooden leg

This one is probably a little less common in the current day and age.
Unfortunately for Sir Arthur Aston, an English soldier best known for supporting
King Charles I during the English Civil War, it was the seventeenth century and
he was the proud owner of a wooden leg.

In 1649, Aston was serving as governor of Drogheda, Ireland. In an attempt to
help establish Ireland as a power base for the English Royalist cause, he had
joined forces with the Marquis of Osmond, the Commander-in-Chief of Royalist
forces in Ireland.

In September of that year, Oliver Cromwell and his troops stormed the city and
proceeded to massacre most of its inhabitants. When Parliamentary soldiers
captured the governor, they had two main priorities: 1) kill this guy, and 2)
check for gold coins inside his wooden leg. There weren’t any coins, but Aston
was literally beaten brainless with his own leg in the process of not finding
any gold. (Berkshire History)

98. Exploding lakes

How about getting killed by an exploding lake? It doesn’t happen too often, but
that’s exactly how Lake Nyos decided to off nearly 1,800 people in 1986. Thanks
to a pool of magma 50 miles below the surface, dangerous gases had been
collecting at the bottom of the crater lake. On August 21, a rare natural
phenomenon known as limnic eruption unleashed a murderous bubble of carbon
dioxide upon the surrounding villages.

Most lakes have water layers that mix or “turn over” frequently, allowing gases
to escape slowly into the atmosphere. Limnic eruption occurs when a deep water
layer becomes saturated with dissolved gases over a long period of time. These
gases are then released by some sort of trigger – for example, a landslide,
heavy rainfall, or an earthquake – that displaces the saturated water and allows
the gases to come out of solution. All at once, the lake overturns with a huge
explosion. It’s like shaking up a soda can and spraying it, except with a lot
more death and destruction.

When Lake Nyos blew up, a geyser of gas and water shot more than 250 feet into
the air, set off an 80-foot tsunami, and spewed out a killer cloud of carbon
dioxide that asphyxiated people as far as 15 miles away.

99. Your enemy’s severed head

Sigurd the Mighty, the ninth-century Viking Earl of Orkney, died a particularly
ironic death after returning from a successful battle. Having defeated his foe
Máel Brigte, Sigurd strapped the Pict’s severed head to his saddle and headed
home. As he was riding, however, Máel’s tooth scraped against Sigurd’s leg and
caused a sore that later became infected in a fatal sort of way. (Orknewyjar)

Thursday, June 28, 2012 WAY TO DIE #88 [HTTP://1001WAYSTODIE.BLOGSPOT.COM/2012/06/WAY-TO-DIE-88.HTML]
SANTA FE, Texas -- A school day ended in tragedy in Santa Fe Friday when a
student was killed in a freak accident while walking down the street.

The 17-year-old Santa Fe High School student was walking down the two-lane road
with his girlflriend around 12 p.m. when his neck was sliced open by a street
sign hanging out of a passing pickup truck.

The pickup truck was driven by a fellow student.

Witnesses said the teen never knew what hit him.

“He was walking, and it got him in the back of the head and he died instantly,”
friend Paul Alexander said.

The student driving the vehicle, an 18-year-old female, stopped after the
accident, but it was too late for the victim.

Police said the student driving the truck is distraught over the incident is not
facing charges.

The signs in the back of the pickup were stolen a few days ago, but
investigators said it’s not clear if the teen driving the truck was involved in
that theft.

Blog Inspired ByThis blog was inspired by the Spike Network TV Show, 1000 Ways
To Die [http://www.spike.com/show/27237]. The show started May 14, 2008, and I
started this blog somewhere in April of 2009. After thinking about it for
awhile, I figured: Why not? The basis of the television show is to recreate
possible unusual deaths and include interviews with experts who describe the
science behind each death. This blog is only scenarios and a collection of other
sories found on the Internet, because, let's face it, I'm no expert!
