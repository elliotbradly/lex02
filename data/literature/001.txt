"smoking", "vampire", "Dylant", "be" and a bunch of others are circled.

It's not working. You give up, and try to sleep. Maybe you'll think of something tomorrow...
As you close your eyes, a deafening crash comes from somewhere. You shriek, finding yourself instinctively shrinking in your chair. After a few seconds, another crash comes, sounding closer than the last one...
endeavouring trembling caution toward radiance, you find no door, only find that the room is freezing cold.
You turn off the computer and run out of your room.
contemplating traveling west, you will find that ive walled off the way with furever bricks. Studying my maziness, i notice thee become a masterbuilder of confusion.
A brick wall has been erected across the hallway. You bang your head against it several times in rage... And then suffer a momentary brainfart as you remember what college students are known for. You go back inside, turn on the compy, and begin to hack into the district's power grid.
screaming barrage of infiltrator manaspheres, you strike gold. The brick wall disappears, revealing a small corridor. Following it further, you find yourself inside a roughly-hewn cavern with organic purple bricks making up the walls. It glows with an otherworldly light.
A hunched beast stirs in the center of the room. It has smooth, pale yellow skin and angular limbs.
dropping erpentrope poison into the cave's ripples, it does nothing. Allitems arc slain by gates of electricity. You laugh, because that was so funny you don't know why and how.
Standing on two feet, it should be around your height. However, its limbs are angular and jointed in strange ways: knees bending backwards, elbows pointing away, wrists bending out like shoulders.
regarding scales and scutes, ive found the following list of terms to be derogatory toward many groups of people, and all such words have been removed. please use normative language in the future.
But that face... In the pale moonlight filtering from above, its sharp eyes peering at you with a deep crimson gaze, its lipless mouth gasping open to expose a cavernous black throat. That face... You know it so well, as if you'd seen it only yesterday...
framing the biggest cavern of bladed teeth, you refuse to let these emotions overwhelm you. he's not going to make you scream, no matter how scary he is.
You scream as loud as your lungs will let you, before the creature lunges at you
clutches of curling winds, you struggle but am dragged toward the monster's waiting mouth of blades. darkness takes you forever.
fretting mosquito-like stings, your struggles end.
You awake to a field of blue, unable to move so much as an inch. You search desperately for what's holding you down, only to realize that there is nothing. You can't feel anything except the warm glow just beneath your skin. You stand up, finding yourself atop a platform hovering in a starry sky. A cackling sort of laughter chills you to the bone...

> You suffocating heart-sickening valley.
Frightful shadows lurk, sinister and serpentine. Faint echoes of the incessant ticking of a clock that measures the seconds of your life.
Then you hear that terrible laughter once more...
You rush to the edge of the platform, gazing in horror at what lies below: A vast void, infinite in size. Countless winged serpents writhe below, a scourge that has no place among the earth and skies...

> You climbing american alligators.
Annh hngaahBurble hack gaspFifteen feet long and three tons of meat and bone and teeth and rage, they fly through the cavern towards you with astonishing speed.
You duck your head, trying not to look like food, but you can feel the creature's bloodlust deep in your soul.You slowly step back, then rush towards the next staircase. Predictably, the alligator beast lunges towards you. Desperately, you sprint up the stairs.

> You mysterious image-gathering.
Mostly, you are obsessed with mysterious things of nature, particularly the more macabre parts. You draw these images onto paper, re-creating them in pencil, water colours, paints... Anything which has any degree of ability to show these glimpses into another world.
Still, there is one thing that has caught your attention far above all others. It stares at you from the wall across the room.

> You pusspack emptying grimy uncompromising doorbell.
You stand at the bottom of a short stairway. A gloomy red light glares softly off the walls from somewhere beyond, casting angular shadows. Still, it is not particularly bright; whomever chose the lighting had a decidedly somber mood. The air is stale, faintly scented by pine needles and camphor.A large, darkened room sits before you. Above the door frame sits a sign reading "Slumber Rooms."

> You astryl Wydle accepting thinking plotting weirdos.
The Slumber Rooms are split into small kennels, each with enough room for a grubby mattress to be placed. A pillow sits on top of each of them, odd considering that no one uses pillows when sleeping outdoors. Just beside the stairs is the head of a giant snake made of sheets and a few other spare blankets, which lies unused.
The walls are barren, not a single photo to be seen anywhere.

> You astryl smiling towards groaningm pathways.
The hallway leads only to forking paths. Moving quickly through the darkness, three brightly lit doorways sit at the end of branching hallways, identical to the one you are in now. One door is blue, glowing with an unnatural light. One door is green, pulsing softly. One door is red, casting a sinister crimson light across the walls.

> You endeavouring to emerge through blue Astyrl.
You do not see a blue Astryl here.
Unsettled, you scan the hallway for other options.
The door to the left is painted in large, dark block letters: DERT. The door to the right is more normal, but a sign warns people to take a Number and wait quietly. Finally, the door at the very end of the hallway says "Exit" on it in plain Roman letters.

> You astryl undressing in front of authorities planning token migration.
You awake in the middle of the night, drowsily turning over. It was just a nightmare. You're fine, there's nothing to worry about. You're tucked up in bed, wearing warm pyjamas. Mommy and Daddy lie asleep in their bed beside you. Outside, sirens wail briefly, but they're far away.

> You simo flowing sirens into the Okeenokee Swamp where.
Forest surrounded by mysterious, deadly swamps are so common in fiction that it takes to an hour of googling pictures before you're able to name your particular swamp: the Okeenokee. The Okeenokee Swamps cover between 500 and 1000 square miles of land in southern Georgia.

> You juicy curves camping among curiously expensive.
The Okeefenokee Swamp Park is a haven for all those interested in exploring the beautiful, deadly swamps without getting deadly themselves. There's a boardwalk winding throughout the park, allowing tourists to easily and safely travel through the park's many sights.
Fees apply.

> You wood trestles beach growing with.
After a short walk, you come across a large boardwalk running through the forest. The trees look old and weather-beaten, with bursts of pink and purple flowering out from the trunks. The most common tree is strangely similar to the shady Mimosa trees of Louisianan fame.
Either side of the two foot walkway is filled with mud, but there's no chance of that closing in no matter how far you stand from the center...

> You simo disentangle in mud.
You gently release, thin branches snaking into the sticky mud and lifting you into the air. As you hang far above the ground, you turn your head to look at the park around you. It's surrounded by evenly spaced pines, tall and evergreen. People wander the boardwalk in the orange surveyor's uniform, while little red arrows painted on posts ensure that no one gets lost.

> You noticing Greasy Gallon.
Twenty feet away from the trees a rusty service cart sits alone, heaving under the weight of a heavy-set woman. She wears the traditional garb of all walkway attendants: orange cotton short shorts and an oversized yellow button-up shirt. Her short brown hair stands on end.
The words "Slimy's Swamp Safari" are written in dripping, watery letters across the back of her shirt.

> You speaking with Greasy Galloon.
"What's this place?"
"This here's the Swamp Safari! My family's run this here business for six generations now."
"What is it?"
"We take people through the swamp, within eyeshot of floating islands, hostile fauna, and nothing but nature!"
She opens a metal box on the side of her cart, pulling out a battered sign.

> You looking at the finger of Greasy Galloon as she points into a design which contains unentertaining trainspotting.
She holds the sign behind her back, and points to one of the pictures: A happy gorilla drinking from a muddy pool.
"We also take people on safari through the marsh. We got all kinds of exciting animals that you can look at and take photographs of while we tell you about 'em and such!" She smiles proudly.
"Interesting." You reply, utterly unimpressed. "I'll have twenty pounds of persimmons for the road, if you please..."

> You listening to Greasy Galloon listing the various types of bird watching available during the Swamp Safari.


> You wonder about the third option which.
The woman takes a ring of keys out of the pocket of her ugly yellow robe and unlocks a door, which squeaks open. She beckons for the four of you to follow her as she leads you inside the room and turns on the light.

> You studying artwork on walls.
On the walls of what turns out to be a small gift shop are four very basic oil paintings of swamp scenes. There's one depicting a large group of 'Cajuns' dancing in a circle around a guy with a guitar, one of alligators swimming among the reeds of the swamp, one which appears to show a 'fairy' seen from behind, and finally one of the odd tiled roof of an old shack protruding up from th long grass.

> You toying with an idea to purchase a painting.
You wonder which of the paintings is worth taking home. None of them are particularly good, but some are always more appealing than others.

> You focusing closer on the large group of dancing 'Cajuns'.
The painting is depicting the kind of scene for which these people have become almost legendary: A group of young people dancing around a musician playing a Cajun accordion. One of the younger men in the crowd has just thrown his head back in order to seize the hand of a smiling young lady dressed in a flowing blue dress, and whirl her around him, exchanging joyful glances. The musician plays on, unperturbed.

> You inspecting detail of flowing blue dress.
The style of the girl's dress tells you that it's probably not a modern painting, and is probably meant to depict life before the Big Heads took over. It's very well-painted, especially in the way it captures the light shining almost magically off the girl's flowing blue skirt as she twirls.
It's also apparent that David Menlo agrees with your assessment that this is definitely the best painting.

> You figuring out what David Menlo is doing right now.
You can easily guess what he's doing right now. He's probably sitting in his comfortable recliner at his home in New York, perhaps sipping a glass of some alcoholic beverage, the way he usually does. He's definitely feeling pleased with himself; putting on this exhibit was a risk for him, but it looks like everything turned out fine after all.

> You discovering the name the current art show.
Unsurprisingly, "David Menlo's Jub Jub Birdwatching Portfolio" sounds like a terrible idea for an art exhibit.
David Menlo is a name you haven't heard in a while. You sort of followed his career since the two of you were graduate students together at Harvard, but he kind of dropped off the map after he dropped out of graduate school.

> You remembering the reason for the difficult and laborious exit.
Laborious doesn't even begin to describe what the hell you just had to go through in order to get this hideous painting.
But it was all worth it, because now you can take this stupid painting home and it will no longer be on your mind, and like all bad memories eventually fade from your mind all together, or at least you hope it works that way.

> You streaming the adventure of Simo Beeing chasing the Cajun painting.
The link is provided here.
This concludes the first 'episode' of David Menlo- The Cajun Painting.

> You hunting the plot line of the first episode.
Strong introductory post. The characters seem like they have potential, and the world you've painted is intriguing. I'm not entirely caught up on what has come before this (I've only read 2 pages of what you've written of this story), so maybe that is why certain important characters and details aren't apparent to me as they might be to a reader who had been with you since the beginning. Obviously there are deeper reasons for New York being the way it is than a simple virus.

> You crossing off all the reasons for leaving New York.
Every reason you can think of for leaving New York City are either non-starters or represent consequences that are worse than staying in the affected area. Plus, at this point, attempting to leave is probably more dangerous than staying put, so you figure you'll do what most other folks in New York will do: Take your chances and hunker down.
You remind yourself to start keeping a few extra cans of food on hand in the apartment.

> You cleaning empty can of Salamander breakfast.
You spend the next several hours erasing your digital footprint. On the computer, you browse exclusively using Incognito mode and clear out your history and cache every time (although due to the anonymity of the Internet it's not like anyone is going to find anything that pinpoints you to your identity). You delete your Facebook account, along with any other accounts you may have had. Finally, you take all the information off of your social security card (name, DOB, etc.

> You deleting link to moaning hot flesh.
Now that you're all set to go off-grid, you put on the bulky jacket you keep in your closet just for this occasion. You take a few moments to enjoy one of your favorite movies, The Matrix trilogy , because who knows if you'll ever have the opportunity to do so again (and because it's awesome). And then, around noon, you go buy a large bundle of wooden matches and ten cans of tuna fish.

> You paying the cost of the supplies.
You stop at some skuzzy convenience store (convenience stores tend to populate the less desirable parts of any city, with the attendant increase in crime) and pick up your supplies. You feel nervous wearing your entire savings on your person, but need outweighs caution and you don't want to risk going to a different store.
As soon as you walk through the door, you're greeted by the smell of old bacon, which permeates every supermarket in the city.

> You considering how the the pork spurt senses are similar to the smell of the Greasy Galloon apartment.
The cashier at the counter is watching a small TV with his feet up.
"Hey buddy," you say, feeling slightly nervous about the fact that he's watching the sheriff's most wanted, "could you turn that down?"
"Huh? Oh yeah," the bored man responds, looking as if he's thoroughly disgusted by something. He turns down the TV and addresses you in an annoyed tone.
"What can I get for you today?

> You thinking about your needs.
You think about what you need.
"Give me a pack of Salem Menthols and a lighter."
The man flipping through the TV channels briefly pauses on a programme showing two women pleasuring one another's sexual organs. You avert your eyes - you've never been comfortable with these types of broadcasts, which the Greasy Galloon's cable companies are notorious for. Perhaps someone hacked into the network at the coffee shop? The pixelation makes it hard to identify.

> You becoming thankful with a witnessing of only a hundred pink pixels.
"You want something else?" says the attendant in a bored tone. "A rolling paper for your cigarette?"
"No, I'm good, thanks," you say, snatching my change and leaving the store.
Outside of the Greasy Galloon apartment isn't much better - although today there are two skin-crawlers making out on the pavement instead of four. You give them a wide berth as you approach the entrance to your building.

> You classifying the kissing skin-crawlers.
"Why do I feel guilty for avoiding those two?" you ponder, as you descend in the entryway of your apartment building.
The apartment building lobby is full of rubbish: a discarded sofas soaked with foul liquid, walls speckled with v stains and a rank smell of sewage pervading the air.

> You laughing that the air lost its bacon smell.
You dial the combination to your lock and rifle through your mail while fishing out your set of keys. A Netflix DVD, offers for credit cards you don't need, update from your phone company and another, scented envelope divine: Love Letters!
Well, well. Someone is in lvoe. You rip open the envelope and start reading:
Virgil,
I hope you llike this touching short story I thought about you!

> You reading short story.
The features of Mr. White were very sharp and thin, almost like a corpse. Unlike other men you had seen the expression in his eyes never changed from the blank look, as ifhe were sleepwalking all the time. It was well known that his wife had divorced him years ago on grounds ofimpotency, and linked closely to that his lack of any interesting in anything at all, and the story he told you about losing his front teeth.

Standing on two feet, it should be around your height. However, its limbs are angular and jointed in strange ways: knees bending backwards, elbows pointing away, wrists bending out like shoulders.

But that face... In the pale moonlight filtering from above, its sharp eyes peering at you with a deep crimson gaze, its lipless mouth gasping open to expose a cavernous black throat. That face... You know it so well, as if you'd seen it only yesterday...
framing the biggest cavern of bladed teeth, you refuse to let these emotions overwhelm you. he's not going to make you scream, no matter how scary he is.
You scream as loud as your lungs will let you, before the creature lunges at you
clutches of curling winds, you struggle but am dragged toward the monster's waiting mouth of blades. darkness takes you forever.
fretting mosquito-like stings, your struggles end.
You awake to a field of blue, unable to move so much as an inch. You search desperately for what's holding you down, only to realize that there is nothing. You can't feel anything except the warm glow just beneath your skin. You stand up, finding yourself atop a platform hovering in a starry sky. A cackling sort of laughter chills you to the bone...

> You suffocating heart-sickening valley.
Frightful shadows lurk, sinister and serpentine. Faint echoes of the incessant ticking of a clock that measures the seconds of your life.
Then you hear that terrible laughter once more...
You rush to the edge of the platform, gazing in horror at what lies below: A vast void, infinite in size. Countless winged serpents writhe below, a scourge that has no place among the earth and skies...

> You climbing american alligators.
Annh hngaahBurble hack gaspFifteen feet long and three tons of meat and bone and teeth and rage, they fly through the cavern towards you with astonishing speed.
You duck your head, trying not to look like food, but you can feel the creature's bloodlust deep in your soul.You slowly step back, then rush towards the next staircase. Predictably, the alligator beast lunges towards you. Desperately, you sprint up the stairs.

> You mysterious image-gathering.
Mostly, you are obsessed with mysterious things of nature, particularly the more macabre parts. You draw these images onto paper, re-creating them in pencil, water colours, paints... Anything which has any degree of ability to show these glimpses into another world.
Still, there is one thing that has caught your attention far above all others. It stares at you from the wall across the room.

> You pusspack emptying grimy uncompromising doorbell.
You stand at the bottom of a short stairway. A gloomy red light glares softly off the walls from somewhere beyond, casting angular shadows. Still, it is not particularly bright; whomever chose the lighting had a decidedly somber mood. The air is stale, faintly scented by pine needles and camphor.A large, darkened room sits before you. Above the door frame sits a sign reading "Slumber Rooms."

> You astryl Wydle accepting thinking plotting weirdos.
The Slumber Rooms are split into small kennels, each with enough room for a grubby mattress to be placed. A pillow sits on top of each of them, odd considering that no one uses pillows when sleeping outdoors. Just beside the stairs is the head of a giant snake made of sheets and a few other spare blankets, which lies unused.
The walls are barren, not a single photo to be seen anywhere.

> You astryl smiling towards groaningm pathways.
The hallway leads only to forking paths. Moving quickly through the darkness, three brightly lit doorways sit at the end of branching hallways, identical to the one you are in now. One door is blue, glowing with an unnatural light. One door is green, pulsing softly. One door is red, casting a sinister crimson light across the walls.

> You endeavouring to emerge through blue Astyrl.
You do not see a blue Astryl here.
Unsettled, you scan the hallway for other options.
The door to the left is painted in large, dark block letters: DERT. The door to the right is more normal, but a sign warns people to take a Number and wait quietly. Finally, the door at the very end of the hallway says "Exit" on it in plain Roman letters.

> You astryl undressing in front of authorities planning token migration.
You awake in the middle of the night, drowsily turning over. It was just a nightmare. You're fine, there's nothing to worry about. You're tucked up in bed, wearing warm pyjamas. Mommy and Daddy lie asleep in their bed beside you. Outside, sirens wail briefly, but they're far away.

> You simo flowing sirens into the Okeenokee Swamp where.
Forest surrounded by mysterious, deadly swamps are so common in fiction that it takes to an hour of googling pictures before you're able to name your particular swamp: the Okeenokee. The Okeenokee Swamps cover between 500 and 1000 square miles of land in southern Georgia.

> You juicy curves camping among curiously expensive.
The Okeefenokee Swamp Park is a haven for all those interested in exploring the beautiful, deadly swamps without getting deadly themselves. There's a boardwalk winding throughout the park, allowing tourists to easily and safely travel through the park's many sights.
Fees apply.

> You wood trestles beach growing with.
After a short walk, you come across a large boardwalk running through the forest. The trees look old and weather-beaten, with bursts of pink and purple flowering out from the trunks. The most common tree is strangely similar to the shady Mimosa trees of Louisianan fame.
Either side of the two foot walkway is filled with mud, but there's no chance of that closing in no matter how far you stand from the center...

> You simo disentangle in mud.
You gently release, thin branches snaking into the sticky mud and lifting you into the air. As you hang far above the ground, you turn your head to look at the park around you. It's surrounded by evenly spaced pines, tall and evergreen. People wander the boardwalk in the orange surveyor's uniform, while little red arrows painted on posts ensure that no one gets lost.

> You noticing Greasy Gallon.
Twenty feet away from the trees a rusty service cart sits alone, heaving under the weight of a heavy-set woman. She wears the traditional garb of all walkway attendants: orange cotton short shorts and an oversized yellow button-up shirt. Her short brown hair stands on end.
The words "Slimy's Swamp Safari" are written in dripping, watery letters across the back of her shirt.

> You speaking with Greasy Galloon.
"What's this place?"
"This here's the Swamp Safari! My family's run this here business for six generations now."
"What is it?"
"We take people through the swamp, within eyeshot of floating islands, hostile fauna, and nothing but nature!"
She opens a metal box on the side of her cart, pulling out a battered sign.

> You looking at the finger of Greasy Galloon as she points into a design which contains unentertaining trainspotting.
She holds the sign behind her back, and points to one of the pictures: A happy gorilla drinking from a muddy pool.
"We also take people on safari through the marsh. We got all kinds of exciting animals that you can look at and take photographs of while we tell you about 'em and such!" She smiles proudly.
"Interesting." You reply, utterly unimpressed. "I'll have twenty pounds of persimmons for the road, if you please..."

> You listening to Greasy Galloon listing the various types of bird watching available during the Swamp Safari.


> You wonder about the third option which.
The woman takes a ring of keys out of the pocket of her ugly yellow robe and unlocks a door, which squeaks open. She beckons for the four of you to follow her as she leads you inside the room and turns on the light.

> You studying artwork on walls.
On the walls of what turns out to be a small gift shop are four very basic oil paintings of swamp scenes. There's one depicting a large group of 'Cajuns' dancing in a circle around a guy with a guitar, one of alligators swimming among the reeds of the swamp, one which appears to show a 'fairy' seen from behind, and finally one of the odd tiled roof of an old shack protruding up from th long grass.

> You toying with an idea to purchase a painting.
You wonder which of the paintings is worth taking home. None of them are particularly good, but some are always more appealing than others.

> You focusing closer on the large group of dancing 'Cajuns'.
The painting is depicting the kind of scene for which these people have become almost legendary: A group of young people dancing around a musician playing a Cajun accordion. One of the younger men in the crowd has just thrown his head back in order to seize the hand of a smiling young lady dressed in a flowing blue dress, and whirl her around him, exchanging joyful glances. The musician plays on, unperturbed.

> You inspecting detail of flowing blue dress.
The style of the girl's dress tells you that it's probably not a modern painting, and is probably meant to depict life before the Big Heads took over. It's very well-painted, especially in the way it captures the light shining almost magically off the girl's flowing blue skirt as she twirls.
It's also apparent that David Menlo agrees with your assessment that this is definitely the best painting.

> You figuring out what David Menlo is doing right now.
You can easily guess what he's doing right now. He's probably sitting in his comfortable recliner at his home in New York, perhaps sipping a glass of some alcoholic beverage, the way he usually does. He's definitely feeling pleased with himself; putting on this exhibit was a risk for him, but it looks like everything turned out fine after all.

> You discovering the name the current art show.
Unsurprisingly, "David Menlo's Jub Jub Birdwatching Portfolio" sounds like a terrible idea for an art exhibit.
David Menlo is a name you haven't heard in a while. You sort of followed his career since the two of you were graduate students together at Harvard, but he kind of dropped off the map after he dropped out of graduate school.

> You remembering the reason for the difficult and laborious exit.
Laborious doesn't even begin to describe what the hell you just had to go through in order to get this hideous painting.
But it was all worth it, because now you can take this stupid painting home and it will no longer be on your mind, and like all bad memories eventually fade from your mind all together, or at least you hope it works that way.

> You streaming the adventure of Simo Beeing chasing the Cajun painting.
The link is provided here.
This concludes the first 'episode' of David Menlo- The Cajun Painting.

> You hunting the plot line of the first episode.
Strong introductory post. The characters seem like they have potential, and the world you've painted is intriguing. I'm not entirely caught up on what has come before this (I've only read 2 pages of what you've written of this story), so maybe that is why certain important characters and details aren't apparent to me as they might be to a reader who had been with you since the beginning. Obviously there are deeper reasons for New York being the way it is than a simple virus.

> You crossing off all the reasons for leaving New York.
Every reason you can think of for leaving New York City are either non-starters or represent consequences that are worse than staying in the affected area. Plus, at this point, attempting to leave is probably more dangerous than staying put, so you figure you'll do what most other folks in New York will do: Take your chances and hunker down.
You remind yourself to start keeping a few extra cans of food on hand in the apartment.

> You cleaning empty can of Salamander breakfast.
You spend the next several hours erasing your digital footprint. On the computer, you browse exclusively using Incognito mode and clear out your history and cache every time (although due to the anonymity of the Internet it's not like anyone is going to find anything that pinpoints you to your identity). You delete your Facebook account, along with any other accounts you may have had. Finally, you take all the information off of your social security card (name, DOB, etc.

> You deleting link to moaning hot flesh.
Now that you're all set to go off-grid, you put on the bulky jacket you keep in your closet just for this occasion. You take a few moments to enjoy one of your favorite movies, The Matrix trilogy , because who knows if you'll ever have the opportunity to do so again (and because it's awesome). And then, around noon, you go buy a large bundle of wooden matches and ten cans of tuna fish.

> You paying the cost of the supplies.
You stop at some skuzzy convenience store (convenience stores tend to populate the less desirable parts of any city, with the attendant increase in crime) and pick up your supplies. You feel nervous wearing your entire savings on your person, but need outweighs caution and you don't want to risk going to a different store.
As soon as you walk through the door, you're greeted by the smell of old bacon, which permeates every supermarket in the city.

> You considering how the the pork spurt senses are similar to the smell of the Greasy Galloon apartment.
The cashier at the counter is watching a small TV with his feet up.
"Hey buddy," you say, feeling slightly nervous about the fact that he's watching the sheriff's most wanted, "could you turn that down?"
"Huh? Oh yeah," the bored man responds, looking as if he's thoroughly disgusted by something. He turns down the TV and addresses you in an annoyed tone.
"What can I get for you today?

> You thinking about your needs.
You think about what you need.
"Give me a pack of Salem Menthols and a lighter."
The man flipping through the TV channels briefly pauses on a programme showing two women pleasuring one another's sexual organs. You avert your eyes - you've never been comfortable with these types of broadcasts, which the Greasy Galloon's cable companies are notorious for. Perhaps someone hacked into the network at the coffee shop? The pixelation makes it hard to identify.

> You becoming thankful with a witnessing of only a hundred pink pixels.
"You want something else?" says the attendant in a bored tone. "A rolling paper for your cigarette?"
"No, I'm good, thanks," you say, snatching my change and leaving the store.
Outside of the Greasy Galloon apartment isn't much better - although today there are two skin-crawlers making out on the pavement instead of four. You give them a wide berth as you approach the entrance to your building.

> You classifying the kissing skin-crawlers.
"Why do I feel guilty for avoiding those two?" you ponder, as you descend in the entryway of your apartment building.
The apartment building lobby is full of rubbish: a discarded sofas soaked with foul liquid, walls speckled with v stains and a rank smell of sewage pervading the air.

> You laughing that the air lost its bacon smell.
You dial the combination to your lock and rifle through your mail while fishing out your set of keys. A Netflix DVD, offers for credit cards you don't need, update from your phone company and another, scented envelope divine: Love Letters!
Well, well. Someone is in lvoe. You rip open the envelope and start reading:
Virgil,
I hope you llike this touching short story I thought about you!

> You reading short story.
The features of Mr. White were very sharp and thin, almost like a corpse. Unlike other men you had seen the expression in his eyes never changed from the blank look, as ifhe were sleepwalking all the time. It was well known that his wife had divorced him years ago on grounds ofimpotency, and linked closely to that his lack of any interesting in anything at all, and the story he told you about losing his front teeth.

  PREFACE: IN PRAISE OF DIALOGUE


We talk.
    Talk, more than any other trait, expresses our humanity. We whisper to
lovers, curse enemies, argue with plumbers, praise the dog, swear on our
mother’s grave. Human relationships are in essence long, long talks into,
around, through, and out of the entanglements that stress or bless our days.
Face-to-face talk between family and friends may go on for decades, while
self-to-self talk never ends: A guilt-ridden conscience scolds
unconscionable desires, ignorance ridicules wisdom, hope consoles despair,
impulse mocks caution, and wit laughs at it all as the inner voices of our
best and worst selves argue to our last breath.
    Over decades, this downpour of talk can drain words of their meaning,
and when meaning erodes, our days shallow out. But what time dilutes,
story condenses.
    Authors concentrate meaning by first eliminating the banalities, minutia,
and repetitious chatter of daily life. They then build their tellings to a crisis
of complex, conflicting desires. Under pressure, words fill with connotation
and nuance. What a character says in the face of conflict radiates the
meanings hidden beneath her words. Expressive dialogue becomes a
translucency through which readers and audiences perceive thoughts and
feelings shadowed in the silence behind a character’s eyes.
    Fine writing turns audiences and readers into virtual psychics.
Dramatized dialogue has the power to unite two unspoken realms: the inner
life of a character and the inner life of the reader/audience. Like radio
transmitters, one subconscious tunes to another as our instincts sense the
churnings within characters. As Kenneth Burke put it, stories equip us to
live in the world, in intimacy with others, and, most importantly, in
intimacy with ourselves.
    Authors give us this power through a series of steps: First, they create
those metaphors for human nature we call characters. Next, they dig into
the characters’ psychologies to unearth conscious wishes and subconscious
desires, those longings that impel inner and outer selves. With this insight in
hand, writers clash the characters’ most compelling desires into flashpoints
of conflict. Scene after scene, they interlace their characters’ actions and
reactions around turning points of change. In a last step, authors let their
characters speak, but not in the repetitious monotones of the everyday,
rather in the demi-poetry known as dialogue. Like an alchemist, a writer
mixes and molds concoctions of character, conflict, and change, and then
gilds them with dialogue, transforming the base metal of existence into the
burnished gold of story.
    Once spoken, dialogue carries us on waves of sensation and substance
that reverberate through the said to the unsaid and the unsayable. The said
are those ideas and emotions a character chooses to express to others; the
unsaid are those thoughts and feelings a character expresses in an inner
voice but only to himself; the unsayable are those subconscious urges and
desires a character cannot express in words, even to himself, because they
are mute and beyond awareness.
    No matter how lavish a play’s production, how vivid a novel’s
descriptions, how lush a film’s photography, character talk shapes the
deepest complexities, ironies, and innerness of story. Without expressive
dialogue, events lack depth, characters lose dimension, and story flattens.
More than any other technique of characterization (gender, age, dress, class,
casting), dialogue has the power to pull a story up through life’s
multilayered strata, thus lifting a merely complicated telling into the full
array of complexity.
    Do you, like me, memorize favorite lines? I think we learn dialogue
passages by heart because reciting them again and again not only re-inspires
the vivid word-pictures they paint, but in the echoes of the character’s
thoughts we hear our own:

   Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow,
   Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
   To the last syllable of recorded time,
   And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
   The way to dusty death.
                                   —Macbeth in The Tragedy of Macbeth

   Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world she walks into
   mine.
                                              —Rick in CASABLANCA

   Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to
   the last I grapple with thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s
   sake I spit my last breath at thee.
                                                     —Ahab in Moby Dick

   Not that there’s anything wrong with that.
                                                     —Jerry in SEINFELD

    Like these four characters, each of us has suffered the scald of irony, that
flash of insight into what the world has done to us, or worst yet, what we
have done to ourselves, that double-edged moment when life’s joke is on us
and we don’t know whether to grin or groan. But without writers to
marinate these ironies in words, how could we savor their delicious
distaste? Without the mnemonics of dialogue, how could we hold these
paradoxes in memory?
    I love the art of dialogue in all its variety. Moved by that amity, I have
written Dialogue: The Art of Verbal Action on Page, Stage, Screen to
explore the crowning act of story-making: giving voice to your characters.
                      INTRODUCTION


Part One: The Art of Dialogue radically expands the definition of
dialogue and multiplies its usage. Chapters Two through Five look at the
functions, contents, forms, and techniques of character talk across the four
major storytelling media.
    Part Two: Flaws and Fixes pinpoints maladies from incredibility and
clichés to writing on-the-nose and repetitiousness, seeks their causes, then
prescribes cures. To illustrate the varied techniques of crafting dialogue, I
cite examples from novels, plays, films, and television.
    Part Three: Creating Dialogue examines the writer’s final step—
finding the words that create the text. When we say an author has an “ear
for dialogue,” we mean he writes character-specific talk. Each of his
characters speaks with a syntax, rhythm, tonality, and, most importantly,
word choices that no one but that character would use. Ideally, every
character is a walking dictionary of his or her unique collection of words.
Dialogue originality, therefore, begins with vocabulary.
    To illustrate the power of character-specific dialogue, we will look at
scenes from Shakespeare’s play The Tragedy of Julius Caesar, Elmore
Leonard’s novel Out of Sight, Tina Fey’s television series 30 ROCK, and
Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor’s film SIDEWAYS.
    Part Four: Dialogue Design opens with a study of the components of
story and scene design. Chapter Twelve shows how these forms determine
what characters say. Six case studies follow using scenes of balanced
conflict from the cable series THE SOPRANOS, comic conflict from the
network series FRASIER, asymmetric conflict from the play A Raisin in the
Sun, indirect conflict from the novel The Great Gatsby, reflexive conflict
from the novels Fräulein Else and The Museum of Innocence, and implied
conflict from the film LOST IN TRANSLATION.
   In these scansions, we look at the two primary principles of effective
dialogue: First, each exchange of dialogue creates an action/reaction that
progresses the scene. Second, although these actions find expression in the
outer behavior of talk, the wellspring of character action flows invisibly
from the subtext.
   Like a GPS for writers, Dialogue: The Art of Verbal Action offers
guidance to the aspirant and redirection to the perplexed. If you recently
ventured into this art and find yourself backed into a creative cul-de-sac,
Dialogue will put you on the path to excellence; if you write for a living but
have lost your bearings, this book will guide you home.
       PART 1




THE ART OF DIALOGUE
                                      1


          THE FULL DEFINITION OF
                DIALOGUE


           Dialogue: Any words said by any character to anyone.

Tradition defines dialogue as talk between characters. I believe, however,
that an all-encompassing, in-depth study of dialogue begins by stepping
back to the widest possible view of storytelling. From that angle, the first
thing I notice is that character talk runs along three distinctly different
tracks: said to others, said to oneself, and said to the reader or audience.
    I place these three modes of talk under the term “dialogue” for two
reasons: First, no matter when, where, and to whom a character speaks, the
writer must personalize the role with a unique, character-specific voice
worded in the text. Second, whether mental or vocal, whether thought
inside the mind or said out into the world, all speech is an outward
execution of an inner action. All talk responds to a need, engages a purpose,
and performs an action. No matter how seemingly vague and airy a speech
may be, no character ever talks to anyone, even to himself, for no reason, to
do nothing. Therefore, beneath every line of character talk, the writer must
create a desire, intent, and action. That action then becomes the verbal tactic
we call dialogue.
    Let’s survey the three tracks of dialogue:
    One, talk to others. The accurate term for two-way talk is duologue.
Three characters in conversation would generate a trialogue. A family of a
dozen souls gathered for Thanksgiving Day dinner might be called a
multilogue, if such a term existed.
    Two, talk within oneself. Screenwriters seldom ask characters to talk to
themselves; playwrights, on the other hand, often do. As for prose writers,
mental talk is the stuff and substance of their art. Prose has the power to
invade a character’s mind and project inner conflict across the landscape of
thought. Whenever an author tells his story in a first-person or second-
person voice, that voice belongs to a character. Prose, therefore, often fills
with reflexive, self-to-self dialogue that the reader, as it were, overhears.
    Three, talk to readers and audiences. In the theatre, the conventions of
soliloquy and aside allow characters to turn directly to the audience and talk
in confidence. In television and film, this convention usually puts the
character offscreen to talk voice-over, but occasionally calls for the
character to turn to the camera in direct address. In prose, this is the essence
of first-person prose—the character tells his tale to the reader.
    The etymology of the word “dialogue” traces back to two Greek terms:
dia-, meaning “through,” and legein, referring to “speech.” These two terms
translated directly into English become the compound noun “through-
speech”—an action taken through words as opposed to deeds. Every line a
character speaks, whether spoken aloud to others or silently in the mind, is,
in J. L. Austin’s term, a performative: words that perform a task.1
    To say something is to do something, and for that reason, I have
expanded my redefinition of dialogue to name any and all words said by a
character to herself, to others, or to the reader/audience as an action taken to
satisfy a need or desire. In all three cases, when a character speaks, she acts
verbally as opposed to physically, and each of her through-speech actions
moves the scene she’s in from one beat to the next, while at the same time,
it dynamically propels her closer to (positive) or further from (negative) the
satisfaction of her core desire. Dialogue-as-action is the foundation
principle of this book.
    Dialogue carries out its actions in one of two ways: dramatized or
narratized.
DRAMATIZED DIALOGUE

Dramatized means acted out in scenes. Whether the tone is comic or tragic,
dramatized dialogue sends lines back and forth between characters in
conflict. Each line contains an action with a specific intention and causes a
reaction somewhere within the scene.
   This is true even in one-character scenes. When someone says, “I’m
mad at myself,” who is mad at whom? Just as you see your image in a
mirror, you can see yourself in your imagination. To argue within yourself,
your mind creates a second self and talks to it as if it were another person.
A character’s inner dialogue becomes a dynamically dramatized scene
between two conflicted selves of the same person, one of which may or
may not win the argument. Therefore, strictly defined, all monologues are
in fact dialogues. Whenever a character talks, she is always talking to
someone, even if it’s her other side.


NARRATIZED DIALOGUE

Narratized means spoken outside the scene. In these cases, the so-called
fourth wall of realism vanishes, and a character steps out of the story’s
dramatizations. Once again, strictly speaking, narratized speeches are not
monologues but dialogues in which the character takes vocal action to talk
directly to the reader, audience, or self.
    In terms of desire, a first-person narrator in prose or a character
narrating from the stage or screen may simply want to bring the
reader/audience up to date on past events and arouse their curiosity about
future events. She may use narratized dialogue to act out this
straightforward ambition and no more.
    In more complex situations, however, she might, for example, use words
to arm-twist the reader/audience into forgiving her past misdeeds while
prejudicing them to see her enemies from her biased point of view. From
story to story, the possible desires that might move a character to action and
the tactics she uses while talking to the reader/audience seem unlimited.
    The same applies to a character who turns inside her mind to talk to
herself. She may be pursuing any purpose: rerunning a memory for
pleasure, puzzling out whether or not she can trust her lover’s love, building
her hopes by fantasizing about life to come, and so on, as her thoughts roam
the past, present, and possible futures, real and imagined.
    To demonstrate how the same content could be expressed in the three
different modes of dialogue, I’ll work with a passage from the novel Doctor
Glas, written in 1905 by the Swedish author Hjalmar Söderberg.
    The book takes the form of a diary kept by the eponymous protagonist.
A real-life diary records the closet conversations of a diarist talking to
himself; a fictional diary, therefore, must be written so the reader feels that
he somehow overhears these secret inner dialogues.
    In Söderberg’s novel, Dr. Glas wants to save one of his patients (a
woman he secretly loves) from her sexually abusive husband. Day after day
his mind wages moral arguments for and against killing the man; in
nightmare after nightmare he commits the murder. (Later in the book he in
fact poisons the husband.) In an entry dated August 7, a nightmare wakes
him in a cold sweat. Listen in on his rambling narratized dialogue as Glas
tries to convince himself that his horrid dream is not a prophecy:

   “Dreams run like streams.” Hoary proverbial wisdom, I know you
   well. And in reality most of what one dreams is not worth a second
   thought—loose fragments of experience, often the silliest and most
   indifferent fragments of those things consciousness has judged
   unworthy of preservation but which, even so, go on living a shadow
   life of their own in the attics and box-rooms of the mind. But there
   are other dreams. As a lad I remember sitting a whole afternoon
   pondering a geometrical problem, and in the end having to go to bed
   with it still unresolved: asleep, my brain went on working of its own
   accord and a dream gave me the solution. And it was correct. Dreams
   there are, too, like bubbles from the depths. And now I come to think
   of it more clearly—many a time has a dream taught me something
   about myself, often revealed to me wishes I did not wish to wish,
   desires of which I did not wish to take daylight cognizance. These
   wishes, these dreams, I’ve afterward weighed and tested in bright
   sunlight. But rarely have they stood up to daylight, and more often
   than not I’ve flung them back into the foul depths where they belong.
   In the night they might assail me anew, but I recognized them and,
   even in dreams, laughed them to scorn, until they relinquished all
   claim to arise and live in reality and the light of day.2

   In the first line, Glas speaks to a proverb floating in his mind as if the
idea had a mind of its own. Then he turns to argue with his silent, dark
immoral side, a self that roils with murderous desire. By the last sentence,
Glas thinks his better self has won the argument… at least for the moment.
Notice how the sentences roll out in the lengthy, cumulative shapes of
rumination.
   Now suppose Söderberg had written this passage as narratized dialogue
said by Dr. Glas directly to the reader. To write in a voice Glas might use
when talking to another person, Söderberg might give Glas that
authoritative voice that doctors often use when prescribing to a patient. The
sentences might shorten and turn into imperatives. Do’s, don’ts, and buts
might be added to give ideas a sharp twist:

   “Dreams run like streams.” A proverb I know you’ve heard. Don’t
   believe it. Most of what we dream isn’t worth a second thought.
   These fragments of experience are the silly, indifferent things our
   consciousness judges unworthy. Even so, in the attic of your mind
   they go on living a shadow life. That’s unhealthy. But some dreams
   are useful. When I was a boy, I sat a whole afternoon pondering a
   geometrical problem. I went to bed with it unresolved. But in sleep,
   my brain went on working and a dream gave me the solution. Then
   there are dangerous dreams that rise like bubbles from the depths. If
   you dare think about them, they seem to teach you something about
   yourself—a wish you didn’t think you wished, a desire you didn’t
   dare say out loud. Don’t believe them. When weighed and tested,
   these dreams do not stand up to bright daylight. So do what a healthy
   person would do. Fling them back into the foul depths where they
   belong. If at night they assail you anew, laugh at them until they
   relinquish all claim on your reality.

   As a third choice, Söderberg, who also wrote plays, may have chosen to
dramatize these ideas onstage. He could have split the doctor into two
characters: Glas and Markel. In the novel, the journalist Markel is Glas’s
best friend. In a play, Markel might personify the morally righteous side of
Glas, while Glas could play the tormented side that’s tempted toward
murder.
   In the subtext of the scene below, Glas seeks Markel’s help to cure his
troubling dreams. Sensing this, Markel makes positive moral statements in
answer to the doctor’s questions. The text retains the novel’s imagery (the
theatre in fact encourages figurative language), but it changes line design
from cumulative to periodic to aid the actors’ cueing. (See Chapter Five for
studies in line design.)

        Glas and Markel sit in a café. As dusk turns to night, they sip after-dinner brandies.

        GLAS: Do you know the proverb “Dreams run like streams”?

        MARKEL: Yes, my grandmother always said that, but in reality, most dreams are
        just fragments of the day, not worth keeping.

        GLAS: Worthless as they are, they live shadow lives in the attic of the mind.

        MARKEL: In your mind, Doctor, not mine.

        GLAS: But don’t you think dreams give us insights?

        MARKEL: At times. When I was a lad, I spent a whole afternoon pondering a
        geometrical problem and went to bed with it unsolved. But my brain went on
        working and a dream gave me a solution. Next morning I checked and damned if it
        wasn’t correct.

        GLAS: No, I mean something hidden, insights into oneself, bubbles of truth from
        the depths, those dark desires one wouldn’t dare admit over breakfast.

        MARKEL: If I ever had such, and I’m not saying I ever have, I’d fling them back
        into the foul depths where they belong.

        GLAS: And what if these desires came back, night after night?

        MARKEL: Then I’d dream a dream of ridicule and laugh them out of my thoughts.
   These three versions contain the same essential content, but when what’s
said changes direction from told to self, to told to the reader, to told to
another character, language radically changes shape, diction, tonality, and
texture. The three fundamental dialogue modes require three sharply
contrasted writing styles.


DIALOGUE AND THE MAJOR MEDIA

All dialogue, dramatized and narratized, performs in the grand symphony of
story, but from stage to screen to page, its instruments and arrangements
vary considerably. For that reason, a writer’s choice of medium greatly
influences the composition of dialogue—its quantities and qualities.
    The theatre, for example, is primarily an auditory medium. It prompts
audience members to listen more intently than they watch. As a result, the
stage favors voice over image.
    Cinema reverses that. Film is primarily a visual medium. It prompts the
audience to watch more intently than it listens. For that reason, screenplays
favor image over voice.
    The aesthetics of television float between the theatre and cinema.
Teleplays tend to balance voice and image, inviting us to look and listen
more or less equally.
    Prose is a mental medium. Whereas stories performed onstage and
onscreen strike the audience’s ears and eyes directly, literature takes an
indirect path through the reader’s mind. The reader must first interpret the
language, then imagine the sights and sounds it describes (every reader’s
imaginings are her own), and, finally, allow herself to react to what she
envisions. What’s more, because literary characters are actorless, their
author is free to use as much or as little dialogue, as dramatized or
narratized, as he sees fit.
    So let’s look at how a story’s medium shapes its dialogue.


DIALOGUE ONSTAGE
Dramatized Dialogue
The scene is the basic unit of story structure in all four major story media.
In the theatre, the majority of talk plays out as dramatized dialogue,
performed by characters in scenes with other characters.
    The one-character play is no exception. When a lone character paces the
stage, he creates scenes of inner dramatized dialogue by splitting himself in
two, as it were, and pitting his warring selves against each other. If the
character sits back to air his thoughts, these memories, fantasies, and
philosophies play best as inner actions, motivated by a desire and taken
with a purpose. No matter how passive and aimless such musings may seem
on the surface, they are in fact dramatized dialogue, said within a scene by a
conflicted character struggling within himself to understand himself or
forget the past or sell himself on a lie—or any other inner action a
playwright might invent. Samuel Beckett’s Krapp’s Last Tape stands as a
brilliant example of dramatized dialogue in the one-character play.

Narratized Dialogue
In keeping with the theatre’s ancient conventions, a playwright may employ
narratized dialogue by stepping his character out of the flux of scenes and
turning him to the audience to speak in soliloquy, or if very brief, in an
aside.3 What’s revealed is often a confession, a secret, or a revelation of
what a character genuinely thinks, feels, or wants to do but could never say
aloud to another character. For example, the painful contritions of Tom
Wingfield in Tennessee Williams’s The Glass Menagerie.
   In one-person performances like The Year of Magical Thinking, Mark
Twain Tonight, and I Am My Own Wife, the soliloquy becomes an entire
play. These works often stage adaptations of biographies or
autobiographies, and so the actor plays a well-known contemporary (Joan
Didion) or a personage from the past (Mark Twain). In the course of the
evening, the actor may use all three forms of character talk. For the most
part, however, he will confess his story to the audience in narratized
dialogue. Now and then, he might impersonate other characters and act out
scenes from the past in dramatized dialogue.
   Modern stand-up comedy came of age when comics moved from joke
telling to narratized dialogue. A stand-up comedian must either invent a
character to play (Stephen Colbert) or perform a selected, characterized
version of himself (Louis C.K.) for this reason: No one can step onstage as
the exact same self that got out of bed that morning. It takes a persona to
perform.
    Onstage, the line between dramatized and narratized dialogue can shift,
depending on the actor’s interpretation. When Hamlet, for example,
questions his continued existence, does he aim the phrase “To be or not to
be” at the audience or at himself? It’s the actor’s choice.

Narration
On those occasions when a play’s story encompasses a large cast over
decades of time, a playwright may stand a narrator at the side of the stage.
These non-characters perform any number of tasks: They relate historical
exposition, introduce characters, or counterpoint the action with ideas or
interpretations that could not be directly dramatized in scenes.
    Examples: In Donald Hall’s An Evening’s Frost (an enactment of the life
of poet Robert Frost) and Erwin Piscator’s epic theatre adaptation of
Tolstoy’s War and Peace, onstage narrators bring a godlike knowledge of
history and personae to the audience, but they have no personal desires.
They stand above the drama, facilitating the storytelling. By contrast, in
Our Town, playwright Thornton Wilder’s narrator, known as the Stage
Manager, mixes functions. He narrates exposition, guides the audience’s
attitudes, but from time to time, he steps into dramatized scenes to play
some small parts.


DIALOGUE ONSCREEN

Dramatized Dialogue
Like the theatre, the majority of onscreen talk is dramatized dialogue,
spoken in-character on-camera in live action or voiced off-camera in
animation.
Narratized Dialogue
Screen characters narratize dialogue in one of two modes: either off-camera
voice-over over the images, or direct to camera in cinematic soliloquy.
    Off-camera, self-narrating characters have been a staple since movies
began to talk. Sometimes they speak in calm, logical, and reliable voices
(HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER); sometimes they rant in hysterical,
irrational, and unreliable outbursts (PI). Sometimes they make sense out of
bewildering events (MEMENTO); sometimes they counterpoint events
(THE BIG LEBOWSKI). Some characters expose painfully honest thoughts
in dramatized dialogues with their inner selves (ADAPTATION); some hide
their secret self behind excuses and rationalizations (A CLOCKWORK
ORANGE); some comment on their predicaments with wit (MY NAME IS
EARL).
    When characters look down the camera lens and whisper something
secret and personal, it’s usually a self-serving tactic to win us to their side
(HOUSE OF CARDS). Since Bob Hope, comedians have tossed lines and
looks to camera to punch jokes (IT’S GARRY SHANDLING’S SHOW).
And the greatest of all, Woody Allen, uses narratized dialogue both off-
camera and to-camera to charm our empathy and sting gags (ANNIE
HALL).
    In Ingmar Bergman’s WINTER LIGHT, a woman (played by Ingrid
Thulin) sends her ex-lover (Gunnar Bjornstrand) a letter describing his
cowardly failure to love her. As he picks it up to read, Bergman cuts to her
face in close-up as she speaks the letter, eyes direct to camera, for six
uninterrupted minutes. Bergman’s subjective camera transports us into the
ex-lover’s imagination, so that as he envisions her speaking, we identify
with him and his suffering, while Ingrid Thulin’s work to camera ignites
their intimacy.

Narration
In films such as BARRY LYNDON, AMÉLIE, and Y TU MAMÁ
TAMBIÉN, non-character, offscreen narrators with resonant, articulate
voices (Sir Michael Hordern, André Dussollier, Daniel Giménez Cacho,
respectively) link episodes, fill in exposition, and counterpoint the telling.
   Counterpoint narration imports ideas and insights from outside the
story’s world to add dimension and depth to the telling. A narrator, for
example, might lade comedy with drama or leaven drama with comedy; he
might punctuate delusion with reality or reality with fantasy; his comments
might play the political world off against the private realm or the reverse.
As often as not, the ironic observations of this non-character rescues a film
from sentimentality by undercutting the emotional indulgences of its
characters. For example, TOM JONES.


DIALOGUE ON PAGE

Stories performed onstage and onscreen move through the physical media
of air and light, and then enter the mind through the senses of sound and
sight. Stories performed in prose move through the mental medium of
language to find life in the reader’s imagination. Because the imagination is
far more complex, multifaceted, and multileveled than the senses, literature
offers a greater variety and flexibility of dialogue techniques than the
theatre, television, or cinema.
    Stories in prose can be told from either inside the story’s world by a
character or from outside the story’s world by a narrator. This simple
division, however, becomes further complicated by literature’s three point-
of-view choices: first, second, and third person.
    First person. In a first-person telling, a character who refers to herself
with the pronouns “I” or “me” speaks to the reader about events as she
remembers them. She may describe these events or present them
dramatically as scenes in which she and other characters talk directly
among themselves. She may also turn inward and talk to herself. If so, the
reader comes along with her to overhear, as it were, her self-to-self
conversations.
    Because the first-person narrator is a character involved in the story, she
is an imperfect witness to the life around her, unable to comprehend events
in their entirety, often less than objective as she pursues her unspoken or
subconscious desires. For this reason, the reliability of first-person narrators
spans a wide spectrum from trustworthy to deceitful.
    What’s more, the first-person narrator is often more focused on herself
than others, so her inner actions, self-observations, and ruminations tend to
fill the page. The inner life of other characters, therefore, can only be
known by the first-person narrator’s speculations or implications the reader
draws from between the lines.
    An omniscient first-person narrator with preternatural insight into the
thoughts and feelings of other characters is a rare device. This conceit needs
an exceptional explanation. In The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold, for
example, the first-person narrator is the spirit of a murdered girl who looks
down from her otherworldly vantage and sees into the hearts of her family
as they struggle with her disappearance.
    A first-person narrator could be the story’s protagonist (Brother William
of Baskerville in The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco), a confidant to the
protagonist (Dr. Watson to Sherlock Holmes), a group speaking in the first
person plural (The Virgin Suicides by Jeffrey Eugenides), or a distant
observer (Joseph Conrad’s unnamed narrator in Heart of Darkness).
    Third person. In a third-person telling, a narrating intelligence guides
the reader through the story’s events. This intelligence often has deep
insight into the thoughts and feelings of all characters. Even though this
awareness is not a character, it may have strong opinions, moral and
otherwise, about the fictional world and its society. Yet, by convention, it
maintains a distance by referring to the cast with the pronouns “her,” “he,”
and “they.”
    Because this third-person intelligence is not a character, its narration is
not dialogue. Nor is it the transcribed voice of the writer. No one, not even
the most eloquent talk show guest on NPR, goes through life talking in a
third-person voice.
    This non-character may be more or less compassionate than its author,
more or less political, more or less observant, more or less moral. Whatever
the case, in the same fashion the prose writer creates a voice for each of her
characters, she invents a linguistic manner for narration, knowing that in the
same way that audiences put themselves in the hands of onstage and
offscreen narrators, the reader accepts narration as a storytelling
convention, characterless and dialogueless.
    The language used by this intelligence may be profoundly expressive,
and the reader may listen to it in her imagination as if it were someone’s
voice, but it is not. Only characters have true voices. What we call a third-
person narrator’s “voice” is simply the author’s literary style. That is why
the reader feels neither empathy for this voice nor curiosity about the fate of
the consciousness behind it.
    The reader knows via conventions older than Homer that the author
invented this non-character for the sole purpose of putting the telling into
language that the reader can follow. If, on the other hand, this intelligence
should suddenly refer to itself as “I,” a non-character would become a
character, and the telling would shift into first person.
    The breadth of knowledge in third-person narrators ranges from
omniscient to limited; their judgment from morally neutral to morally
critical; their presence in the mind of the reader from overt to covert; their
reliability from truthful to (in very rare cases) deceitful. As the prose writer
plays with these dimensions, he can shade his third-person narrators with
degrees of objectivity/subjectivity, ranging from ironically detached to
deeply invested.
    The third-person objective (a.k.a. covert or dramatic) mode shows far
more than it tells. It observes but never interprets. This awareness sits back
like a patron in the theatre of life, never entering the inner realms, never
describing the thoughts and feelings of any character. Famous examples:
Ernest Hemingway’s short stories such as “Hills Like White Elephants” and
“The Snows of Kilimanjaro.” In the mid-twentieth century, the French
nouveau roman took this technique to its absolute limit in works such as
Jealousy by Alain Robbe-Grillet.
    The third-person subjective mode penetrates the inner life and may
switch between the thoughts and feelings of more than one character. More
often than not, however, the author restricts access to the inner life of the
story’s protagonist only. This mode may feel something like first person but
keeps its distance by using the impersonal pronouns “he” and “she” rather
than “I.”
    In George R. R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series, for example,
each chapter takes up a separate storyline, each restricted to the point of
view of that tale’s protagonist.
    This technique of subjective exploration, in both its limited and
omniscient variants, became the most popular narrative perspective in
twentieth-century prose. A subjective narrator may come with a touch of
personality and overt opinions (see the passage from The Corrections
quoted below), but no matter how playful or sarcastic, how familiar or
personal a third-person narrator may be, this voice is the author’s creature, a
special dimension of himself that he invents to convey his story from
outside its events.
   An author may even choose to let his narrator break the bond of trust
that millennia of poetry and prose has built between writers and their
readers. In rare tellings, writers have given this voice character-like traits of
confusion or duplicity. But, once again, no matter how manipulative,
unreliable, or uncertain a third-person narrator may become, its language is
not dialogue. This is an author speaking from behind a mask. Third-person
narration requires unique strategies and techniques that are outside the
focus of this book.
   Second person. The second-person mode is a disguise for either the first
person or third person. In this mode, the storytelling voice eliminates the
pronouns “I/me” of first person and the “she/he/they” of third person to
address someone as “you.” This “you” could be the protagonist himself.
When, for example, a person berates himself with the thought “you idiot,”
one aspect of the self criticizes another aspect. A second-person voice,
therefore, could be analyzing or encouraging or reminiscing with himself
(Second Thoughts by Michel Butor). Or “you” could be a silent, unnamed
other character, thus turning the telling into a one-sided dramatized dialogue
(A Song of Stone by Iain Banks). Or in the third possibility, “you” could be
the reader. In Jay McInerney’s novel Bright Lights, Big City, an ineffable
awareness takes the reader through the story in the present tense until the
reader feels as if he’s acting out the events himself:

   You’re not sure exactly where you are going. You don’t feel you have
   the strength to walk home. You walk faster. If the sunlight catches
   you on the streets, you will undergo some terrible chemical change.
      After a few minutes you notice the blood on your fingers. You
   hold your hand up to your face. There is blood on your shirt, too. You
   find a Kleenex in your jacket pocket and hold it up to your nose. You
   advance with your head tilted back against your shoulders.4

   If this passage were rewritten into the past tense with “you” switched to
“I,” it would become a conventional first-person novel; if “you” were
changed to “he,” it would become a conventional third-person telling. The
second-person present tense makes this tale ambiguously both, and moves
through a filmic atmosphere akin to subjective camera.
    To help clarify this complexity, let’s compare the conventions of prose to
their equivalent onstage and onscreen.

Dramatized Dialogue
Dramatized scenes in prose can be written from any of the three points of
view—first, second, or third person. In all three voices, scenes take place in
their temporal and spatial settings, the characters and their behaviors are
described, and their talk is quoted verbatim. Conceivably, such scenes could
be lifted off the page and transported, more or less intact, to a theatre or
sound stage to be performed by actors.

Narratized Dialogue
Everything said outside of dramatized scenes in a first-or second-person
voice is, by my definition, narratized dialogue. These passages are spoken
in-character with a story-driven purpose and affect the reader much like an
onstage soliloquy or a direct-to-camera address. When narratized dialogue
modulates into stream of consciousness (see below), the pages read like an
inner monologue in a play or a protagonist’s voice-over in films like
MEMENTO and PI. In all instances, the author writes in-character.


INDIRECT DIALOGUE

All four major media offer the writer the choice to either recall scenes from
the past and describe them, or to put them in front of the reader/audience
and act them out. If he chooses description, what could have been a scene
of dramatized dialogue turns into indirect dialogue.
   Should the writer use a character to describe a prior scene, then her
immediate dialogue paraphrases another character’s previous dialogue. For
example, in this passage from Bruce Norris’s play Clybourne Park, Bev
complains about her husband.

                                               BEV
        —the way he sits up all night long. Last night he was just sitting there at three
        o’clock in the morning and I say to him, “Say, don’t you feel sleepy? Do you want
        to take a Sominex, or play some cards maybe?” and he says, “I don’t see the point
        of it,” as if there has to be some grand justification for every single thing that a
        person does.5

    The audience can only guess at the accuracy of her paraphrases, but in
this context, exactly what was said is not important. Norris uses indirect
dialogue so that the audience hears what is important: Bev’s interpretation
of her husband’s behavior in her own words.
    When third-person narration paraphrases dialogue, once again the reader
must interpret how it sounded when spoken. This scene, for example,
between a husband and wife from Jonathan Franzen’s novel The
Corrections:

   Made happy by pregnancy, she got sloppy and talked about the
   wrong thing to Alfred. Not, needless to say, about sex or fulfillment
   or fairness. But there were other topics scarcely less forbidden, and
   Enid in her giddiness one morning overstepped. She suggested he
   buy shares in a certain stock. Alfred said the stock market was a lot
   of dangerous nonsense best left to wealthy men and idle speculators.
   Enid suggested he nonetheless buy shares of a certain stock. Alfred
   said he remembered Black Tuesday as if it were yesterday. Enid
   suggested he nonetheless buy shares of a certain stock. Alfred said it
   would be highly improper to buy that stock. Enid suggested he
   nonetheless buy it. Alfred said they had no money to spare and now a
   third child coming. Enid suggested that the money could be
   borrowed. Alfred said no. He said no in a much louder voice and
   stood up from the breakfast table. He said no so loudly that a
   decorative copper-plate bowl on the kitchen wall briefly hummed,
   and without kissing her goodbye he left the house for eleven days
   and ten nights.6
   By repeating the word “suggested” five times, Franzen pushes Enid’s
nagging and Alfred’s rage to the edge of farce. The phrase “eleven days and
ten nights” presages their holiday cruise, and the image of a bowl humming
on the wall pushes the scene beyond farce to absurdity.
   Because indirect dialogue invites the reader to imagine the scene, the
heated, possibly melodramatic language of direct dialogue becomes a more
personalized, believable version invented by the reader.
                                      2


       THE THREE FUNCTIONS OF
              DIALOGUE


Dialogue, dramatized and narratized, performs three essential functions:
exposition, characterization, action.


EXPOSITION

Exposition is a term of art that names the fictional facts of setting, history,
and character that readers and audiences need to absorb at some point so
they can follow the story and involve themselves in its outcome. A writer
can embed exposition in the telling in only one of two ways: description or
dialogue.
   Onstage and onscreen, directors and their designers interpret the writer’s
descriptions into every expressive element that isn’t dialogue: settings,
costumes, lighting, props, sound effects, and the like. Comic book artists
and graphic novelists illustrate their stories as they tell them. Prose authors
compose literary descriptions that project word-images into the reader’s
imagination.
   Dialogue can do the same work. For example, picture this: a gilt-
gleaming, marbled lobby with business-dressed, fair-haired visitors signing
in at a security desk manned by uniformed guards, while in the background
busy elevators open and close. The moment we glimpse this image, it
instantly denotes a number of expositional facts: Place—an office building
in a major city somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere. Time—a weekday
between eight a.m. and six p.m. Society—the professional class of Western
culture that hires armed guards to protect the executives on the upper floors
from the poverty class on the streets. What’s more, the subtext of this image
connotes a commercial, competitive, white-male-dominated world, questing
for wealth and power, always on the verge of corruption.
    Now picture a high-energy investment broker lunching with a potential
client. Listen for the implications beneath his glib double entendre: “Come
on up, meet my young hawks. We roost on the seventy-seventh floor and
prey on Wall Street.” In fewer graphemes than a tweet, word-pictures can
express more dimensions than a camera can see.
    Virtually anything expressed in images or explained in narration can be
implied in dialogue. Therefore, the first function of dialogue is to pass
exposition to the eavesdropping reader/audience. The following precepts
guide this difficult work:

Pacing and Timing
Pacing means the rate or frequency with which exposition is spliced into the
telling. Timing means choosing the precise scene and the exact line within
that scene to reveal a specific fact.
    The risks governing the pacing and timing of exposition are these: Give
the story-goer too little exposition and he will disengage in confusion. On
the other hand, big helpings of static exposition choke interest: The reader
puts down the book; audiences shift in their seats, wishing they had bought
more popcorn. Therefore, you must pace and time the placement of
exposition with care and skill.
    To keep interest moving, fine writers parse exposition out, detail by
detail, passing on only what the audience member or reader needs to know
when she absolutely needs and wants to know it. Not a moment before.
They give only the minimal exposition necessary to maintain the flow of
curiosity and empathy.
   If you give the modern, story-savvy reader/audience too much
exposition too soon, not only does their stride shuffle to a crawl, but they
also foresee your turning points, including your ending, long before they
happen. Annoyed and disappointed, they sit in front of your work thinking,
“I saw it coming.” As the nineteenth-century novelist Charles Reade
advised: “Make ’em laugh, make ’em cry, make ’em wait.”
   Lastly, not all expositional facts are of equal value to the telling, and
therefore do not deserve equal emphasis. In a separate file, list every fact in
your story, and then rank them in order of importance to the
reader/audience. As you rewrite and polish your work, you may realize that
certain facts need to be stressed and repeated in more than one scene to
guarantee that the reader/audience remembers them at a critical future
turning point. Other less important facts need only a single hint or gesture.

Showing versus Telling
The axiom “Show, don’t tell” warns against dialogue that substitutes
passive explanations for dynamic dramatization. “To show” means to
present a scene in an authentic setting, populated with believable characters,
struggling toward their desires, taking true-to-the-moment actions while
speaking plausible dialogue. “To tell” means to force characters to halt their
pursuits and talk instead and at length about their life histories or their
thoughts and feelings, or their loves and hates, past and present, for no
reason intrinsic to the scene or its characters. Stories are metaphors for life,
not theses on psychology, environmental crises, social injustice, or any
cause extraneous to the characters’ lives.
    Too often, recitations of this kind simply serve the writer’s extrinsic
need to opine into the ear of the captive reader/audience, rather than a
character’s intrinsic need to take action. What’s worse, telling erases
subtext. As a character copes with antagonisms and pursues desires, her
vocal reactions and tactics invite readers and audiences to seek her
unspoken thoughts and feelings. But when a writer forces unmotivated
exposition into a character’s mouth, these opaque lines block the story-
goer’s access to the speaker’s inner life. And as the character flattens into a
spokesperson for its author’s ideas, interest fades.
   Finally, showing speeds involvement and pace; telling discourages
curiosity and halts pace. Showing treats readers and audiences like adults,
inviting them into the story, encouraging them to open their emotions to the
writer’s vision, to look into the heart of things and then forward to future
events. Telling treats them like a child who a parent sits on a knee to explain
the obvious.
   This speech, for example, is telling: As Harry and Charlie unlock the
door to their dry-cleaning business, Charlie says:

                                            CHARLIE
        Oh, Harry, how long have we known each other now? What, twenty years, maybe
        even more, ever since we were in school together. It’s been a long time, hasn’t it,
        old friend? Well, how are you this fine morning?

   That dialogue has no purpose except to tell the reader/audience that
Charlie and Harry have been friends for over twenty years, went to school
together, and the day is just beginning.
   This speech, on the other hand, shows:
   As Charlie unlocks the door to the dry cleaners, an unshaven Harry,
dressed in a T-shirt, leans against the jamb, toking on a joint and giggling
uncontrollably. Charlie looks over at him and shakes his head.
                                            CHARLIE
        Harry, when in hell are you going to grow up? Look at you and your stupid tie-dyed
        shirts. You’re the same immature ass you were twenty years ago in school and you
        haven’t changed since. Sober up, Harry, and smell the shit you’re in.

    The reader’s imagination or the audience’s eye glances to Harry to
capture his reaction to that insult, and invisibly, as it were, they happened to
have learned “twenty years” and “school.”
    At some point, every vital fictional fact must find its way into the story,
timed to arrive at the most effective moment, loaded to deliver a critical
insight. These details, and the perceptions they inspire, must pass into the
reader/audience’s awareness without distracting them from the flow of
events. Somehow the writer must send the reader/audience’s attention in
one direction while he smuggles a fact in from another.
    This sleight of hand calls upon one of two techniques or both: Narrative
drive and exposition as ammunition. The former skill draws on
intellectual curiosity, the latter emotional empathy.

Narrative Drive
Narrative drive is a side effect of the mind’s engagement with story. Change
and revelations incite the story-goer to wonder, “What’s going to happen
next? What’s going to happen after that? How will this turn out?” As pieces
of exposition slip out of dialogue and into the background awareness of the
reader or audience member, her curiosity reaches ahead with both hands to
grab fistfuls of the future to pull her through the telling. She learns what she
needs to know when she needs to know it, but she’s never consciously
aware of being told anything, because what she learns compels her to look
ahead.
    Witness, for example, the power of exposition to compel narrative drive
in a novel titled after a piece of exposition: Catch-22. The author, Joseph
Heller, invented the term to name bureaucratic traps that cage their victims
in a vicious circle of logic.
    The story takes place on an air force base in the Mediterranean during
World War II. In Chapter Five, Captain John Yossarian, the novel’s
protagonist, asks Dr. Dan Daneeka, the base physician, about a pilot named
Orr:

      “Is Orr crazy?”
      “He sure is,” Doc Daneeka said.
      “Can you ground him?”
      “I sure can. But first he has to ask me to. That’s part of the rule.”
      “Then why doesn’t he ask you to?”
      “Because he’s crazy,” Doc Daneeka said. “He has to be crazy to
   keep flying combat missions after all the close calls he’s had. Sure, I
   can ground Orr. But first he has to ask me to.”
      “That’s all he has to do to be grounded?”
      “That’s all. Let him ask me.”
      “And then you can ground him?” Yossarian asked.
       “No. Then I can’t ground him.”
       “You mean there’s a catch?”
       “Sure there’s a catch,” Doc Daneeka replied. “Catch-22. Anyone
   who wants to get out of combat duty isn’t really crazy.”
       There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified
   that a concern for one’s own safety in the face of dangers that were
   real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy
   and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he
   did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more
   missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he
   didn’t, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was
   crazy and didn’t have to; but if he didn’t want to he was sane and had
   to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of
   this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.
       “That’s some catch, that Catch-22,” he observed.
       “It’s the best there is,” Doc Daneeka agreed.

    Notice how Heller inserted a passage of indirect dialogue into a scene of
dramatized dialogue. The prose paragraph’s summary tells us what Daneeka
said to Yossarian and how Yossarian whistled in reaction to it. Even though
it’s in a third-person voice that adds a touch of authorial commentary, this is
showing and not telling for these reasons: 1) It happens within the scene. 2)
It furthers the dynamic actions of the scene: Daneeka wants Yossarian to
stop pestering him with excuses to get out of combat, and Yossarian
suddenly realizes the futility of claiming to be crazy. Daneeka’s revelation
becomes a turning point that moves the Yossarian plot to the negative.
    In terms of narrative drive, the instant the reader grasps the inescapable
logic of Catch-22, her expectations leap ahead. How, if possible, she
wonders, will Yossarian, or any of the other characters, escape the vise grip
of this absurd military rule? The reader/audience’s constant search for
answers to questions aroused by revelations of exposition propels narrative
drive.

Exposition as Ammunition
The second technique for passing exposition unnoticed to the
reader/audience relies on the story-goer’s emotional involvement. Empathy
begins with this thought: “That character is a human being like me.
Therefore, I want that character to get whatever the character wants because
if I were that character, I’d want the same thing for myself.” The moment a
story-goer recognizes a shared humanity between herself and your
characters, she not only identifies with them but also transfers her real-life
desires onto their fictional desires.
    Once this empathetic connection hooks involvement, the technique of
exposition as ammunition operates in this way: Your cast has the knowledge
of the past, present, themselves, and each other that your readers or
audience members will need to know in order to follow events. Therefore,
at pivotal moments, let your characters use what they know as ammunition
in their struggles to get what they want. These revelations will deliver the
pleasure of discovery to the emotionally invested reader/audience as the
fact quickly vanishes into the story-goer’s background awareness.
    Consider, for example, the original Star Wars trilogy. All three films
hinge on one story-fact: Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker’s father. The
storytelling problem for George Lucas was when and how to deliver that
piece of exposition. He could have revealed it at any point in the first film
by having C-3PO whisper to R2-D2, “Don’t tell Luke, he’d really be upset
to hear this, but Darth’s his dad.” The fact would have reached the audience
but with minimum, almost laughable effect. Instead, he employed
exposition as ammunition to turn the trilogy’s most famous scene.
    At the story climax of the second film, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK,
Luke Skywalker makes a hero’s choice to fight Darth Vader. As lightsabers
clash, the arch-villain takes command and the underdog struggles. Empathy
for Luke and anxiety about outcome lock the audience into the moment.
    In the conventional action climax, the hero finds an unforeseen way to
turn the tables on the villain. Instead, in the midst of the duel, George Lucas
puts in play a motivation he has hidden in the subtext: Darth Vader wants
his estranged son to join him on the infamous dark side, but faces a lesser-
of-two-evils dilemma: Kill his own child, or be killed by him. To escape
this dilemma, Vader uses one of the most famous pieces of exposition in
film history as ammunition to disarm his son: “I am your father.” But,
instead of saving his son with his revelation, he drives Luke to attempt
suicide.
    Suddenly, the truth hidden behind the first two films shocks and moves
the audience to compassion for Luke and fear for his future. This
biographical fact used as ammunition delivers massive retrospective insight
into deep character and past events, floods the audience with feeling, and
sets up the trilogy’s final episode.

Revelations
In almost every story told, comedy or drama, the most important
expositional facts are secrets, dark truths that characters hide from the
world, even from themselves.
    And when do secrets come out in life? When a person faces a lesser-of-
two-evils dilemma: “If I reveal my secret, I risk losing the respect of those I
love” versus “But if I do not reveal my secret, something even worse will
happen.” The pressure of this dilemma pries secrets loose, and as they come
to light, their impact spins powerful turning points. And where do secrets
come from?

         Backstory: Past events that propel future events
Backstory is an often misunderstood term, misused to mean “life history.”
A character’s biography contains a lifelong interaction of genes and
experience. Backstory is a subset of this totality—an excerption of past,
usually secret, events that the writer exposes at key moments to propel his
story to climax. Because revelations from the backstory often inflict more
impact than straightforward actions, they are reserved for major turning
points. Below is a famous example of this technique.

                     Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
In this play written by Edward Albee in 1962, George and Martha, a
middle-aged couple, endure a conflict-filled marriage. For two decades they
have fought constantly over every minute aspect of the raising of their son,
Jim. After an exhausting, raucous, drink-filled, insult-filled, adulterous
party, topped off with a vicious argument about their son in front of their
guests, George turns to Martha and says:

        GEORGE. We got a little surprise for you, baby. It’s about sunny-Jim.

        MARTHA. No more, George….

        GEORGE. YES!… Sweetheart, I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news for you… for
        us, of course. Some rather sad news.

        MARTHA. (afraid, suspicious) What is this?

        GEORGE. (oh, so patiently) Well, Martha, while you were out of the room… well,
        the doorbell chimed… and… well, it’s hard to tell you, Martha…

        MARTHA. (a strange throaty voice) Tell me.

        GEORGE. … and… what it was… it was good old Western Union, some little boy
        about seventy.

        MARTHA. (involved) Crazy Billy?

        GEORGE. Yes, Martha, that’s right… Crazy Billy… and he had a telegram, and it
        was for us, and I have to tell you about it.

        MARTHA. (as if from a distance) Why didn’t they phone it? Why did they bring it;
        why didn’t they telephone it?

        GEORGE. Some telegrams you have to deliver, Martha, some telegrams you can’t
        phone.

        MARTHA. (rising) What do you mean?

        GEORGE. Martha… I can hardly bring myself to say it… (sighing heavily) Well,
        Martha… I’m afraid our boy isn’t coming home for his birthday.

        MARTHA. Of course he is.

        GEORGE. No, Martha.

        MARTHA. Of course he is. I say he is!

        GEORGE. He… can’t.
MARTHA. He is! I say so!

GEORGE. Martha… (long pause)… our son is… dead. (silence) He was…
killed… late in the afternoon… (a tiny chuckle)… on a country road, his learner’s
permit in his pocket, he swerved, to avoid a porcupine, and drove straight into a…

MARTHA. (rigid fury) YOU… CAN’T… DO… THAT!

GEORGE. … large tree.

MARTHA. YOU CANNOT DO THAT.

GEORGE. (quietly, dispassionately) I thought you should know.

MARTHA. (quivering with rage and loss) NO! NO! YOU CANNOT DO THAT!
YOU CAN’T DECIDE THAT FOR YOURSELF! I WILL NOT LET YOU DO
THAT!

GEORGE. We’ll have to leave around noon, I suppose…

MARTHA. I WILL NOT LET YOU DECIDE THESE THINGS!

GEORGE: … because there’s matters of identifications, naturally, and
arrangements to be made…

MARTHA. (leaping at him, but ineffectual) YOU CAN’T DO THIS! I WILL NOT
LET YOU DO THIS!

GEORGE. You do not seem to understand, Martha; I haven’t done anything. Now
pull yourself together. Our son is DEAD! Can you get that into your head?

MARTHA. YOU CAN’T DECIDE THESE THINGS!

GEORGE. Now listen, Martha; listen carefully. We got a telegram; there was a car
accident; and he’s dead. POUF! Just like that! Now, how do you like it?

MARTHA. (a howl that weakens into a moan) NOOOOOOoooooo… (pathetic)
No; no, he is not dead; he is not dead.

GEORGE. He is dead. Kyrie, eleison. Christie, eleison. Kyrie, eleison.

MARTHA. You cannot. You may not decide these things.
        GEORGE. That’s right, Martha; I’m not God. I don’t have power over life and
        death, do I?

        MARTHA. YOU CAN’T KILL HIM! YOU CAN’T HAVE HIM DIE!

        GEORGE. There was a telegram, Martha.

        MARTHA. (up, facing him) Show it to me! Show me the telegram!

        GEORGE. (long pause; then, with a straight face) I ate it.

        MARTHA. (a pause; then with the greatest disbelief possible, tinged with hysteria)
        What did you just say to me?

        GEORGE. (barely able to stop exploding with laughter) I… ate… it. (Martha stares
        at him for a long time, then spits in his face) Good for you, Martha.


   The climax of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? turns on the revelation of
George and Martha’s backstory secret: Jim, their contentious son, is
imaginary. They made him up to fill their empty marriage. The use of
backstory to turn story is the single most powerful technique in the
execution of exposition.

Direct Telling
The admonition to show rather than tell only applies to dramatized dialogue
in acted scenes. Skillful, straightforward telling, whether on page, stage, or
screen, whether in narratized dialogue or third-person narration, has two
vital virtues: speed and counterpoint.
    1) Speed. Narration can pack a lot of exposition into a few fast words,
plant understanding in the reader/audience, and move on. Inner monologues
have the power to turn subtext into text in a blink. A character’s
conversations with herself can leap randomly from memory to memory in
free association, or flash with images that bob up from her subconscious.
Such passages, beautifully written, can move emotion within a sentence.
For example, from the Gabriel García Márquez novel One Hundred Years of
Solitude: “Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano
Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to
discover ice.” This is swift, vivid telling—a complex, concentrated image in
a single sentence.
    However, all too often, filmic narration becomes a device to pump out
bland exposition in the format of “and then… and then… and then.” This
practice substitutes the easy work of telling for the arduous task of showing.
Dialogue scenes on film and television that dramatize complex characters
demand talent, knowledge, and imagination; word-thick narrations need
only a keyboard.
    To turn narratized exposition into a dramatized scene, call upon one of
two techniques:
    One, interpolate a scene. Convert the “and then… and then… and then”
of telling into a narrated scene of dramatized “I said/(s)he said.” Narrators
(whether first person in prose, onstage, or voice-over onscreen) can either
act out a scene’s dialogue verbatim from memory or use indirect dialogue to
suggest it.
    The Netflix series HOUSE OF CARDS, for example, often interpolates
scenes of indirect dialogue. Kevin Spacey’s Frank Underwood frequently
turns to the camera and talks to us as if he were a professor and we his
students in a course on political tradecraft. In the aside below, Underwood
dramatizes exposition by giving us insights into himself as well as a
character named Donald. Underwood acts out Donald’s character flaw in
this vivid, two-sentence metaphorical scene:

   What a martyr craves more than anything is a sword to fall on. So
   you sharpen the blade, hold it at the right angle, and then 3, 2, 1…

    In the next beat, just as Professor Frank predicted, Donald takes the fall
for Underwood’s misdeeds.
    Two, generate inner conflict. Stage a self-to-self duel in which one side
of a narrating character argues with another. Two film examples: Frank
Pierce (Nicolas Cage) in Martin Scorsese’s BRINGING OUT THE DEAD,
or the adult Ralphie Parker (Jean Shepherd) in Bob Clark’s A CHRISTMAS
STORY.
    2) Counterpoint. In my experience, the narration technique that most
enriches a story is counterpoint. Rather than using a narrator to tell the tale,
some writers fully dramatize their story, then appoint a narrator to
contradict or ironize its themes. They may use wit to ridicule the dramatic,
or the dramatic to deepen the satire. They may counterpoint the personal
with the social, or the social with the personal.
    Take, for example, John Fowles’s postmodern, historical, antinovel
novel, The French Lieutenant’s Woman. Half the pages dramatize the story
of Charles Smithson, a Victorian gentleman, and his involvement with
Sarah Woodruff, a disgraced governess. Interlaced with this tale, however, a
narrator with modern knowledge of nineteenth-century culture and class
conflicts undercuts the Charles and Sarah romance. Counterpoint after
counterpoint, the narrator argues that the nineteenth century offered women
without means far more misery than romance.
    Other examples: In Y TU MAMÁ TAMBIÉN the voice-over narrator
frequently reminds the audience of Mexico’s social suffering as a
counterpoint to the coming-of-age drama. Woody Allen’s witty voice-over
in ANNIE HALL counterpoints his protagonist’s self-inquisition. In Samuel
Beckett’s play Play, a trio of characters, buried to the neck in urns, stare out
over the audience and narrate their seemingly random thoughts in a three-
way system of counterpoint.
    Prose is the natural medium for direct telling. The novelist and short-
story writer can foreground exposition as nakedly as they wish, and draw it
out for as many pages as they wish, so long as their language captivates and
satisfies. Charles Dickens, for example, opens A Tale of Two Cities with a
burst of counterpointing exposition that hooks the reader’s curiosity:

   It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
   wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it
   was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the
   season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of
   despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we
   were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other
   way…

   Notice how Dickens’s omniscient third-person narration uses “we” to
put an arm around the reader’s shoulder and draw him into the telling.
Compare that to the confrontational first-person, fast-paced voice of “I” that
opens Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man:
   I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted
   Edgar Allan Poe; nor am I one of your Hollywood-movie
   ectoplasms. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and
   liquids—and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible,
   understand, simply because people refuse to see me. Like the
   bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows, it is as though
   I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard, distorting glass. When
   they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or
   figments of their imagination—indeed, everything and anything
   except me.

    In later chapters, both Dickens and Ellison dramatize scenes, but some
prose writers never do. Instead, they pave page after page with direct telling
narration, never acting out a single event.
    Try to imagine how you might dramatize the exposition in the two
passages above into scenes of actable dialogue. In theory it could be done.
Shakespeare could have managed it, but with what difficulty? When writing
for readers, telling works wonders. When writing for actors, the reverse is
true.
    Ideally, in the performance arts of stage and screen, exposition flows to
the audience unnoticed within the spoken words. As we’ve seen, the craft of
rendering exposition invisible takes patience, talent, and technique. Lacking
those three qualities, impatient and uninspired screenwriters force
exposition on the audience and hope to be forgiven.


Forced Exposition
Since the dawn of cinema, filmmakers have inserted shots of newspapers
with foot-high headlines announcing events such as “War!” They have
walked characters past televisions or radios conveniently tuned to a news
broadcast of exactly what the audience needs to know precisely when it
needs to know it. Rapidly edited montages and split-screen collages have
packed screens with as much information as possible in the briefest possible
time. Filmmakers rationalize these devices with the notion that if exposition
comes fast and flashy, it won’t bore the audience. They would be wrong.
    Similar thinking governs opening films with a title roll, as did STAR
WARS (which delivered rapid-fire exposition and a tone of grandiosity), or
closing with one, as did A FISH CALLED WANDA (which got laughs and
a touch more closure). When thrillers race against time, hopscotching from
place to place, they often superimpose location names and dates over
establishing shots. In such cases, a little telling goes a long way. With a
brief halt for a cogent image or a quick-printed fact, the story stubs its toe
but then strides on, and the audience shrugs it off.
    But audiences will not forgive a deluge of facts artlessly shoehorned into
dialogue for no reason intrinsic to the characters or the scene. When inept
writing forces characters to tell each other facts they already know, the pace
trips over a high hurdle, falls face-first in the cinders, and may never get up.
    For example:

        INT. LUXURIOUS GREAT ROOM—DAY

        John and Jane sit on a silk-tasseled sofa, sipping martinis.


                                                 JOHN
        Oh my goodness, darling, how long have we known and loved each other now?
        Why, it’s over twenty years, isn’t it?


                                                 JANE
        Yes, ever since we were at the university together, and your fraternity threw a mixer
        and invited the Women’s Socialist Club. Your house was so rich, we poor girls
        called Beta Tau Zeta Billions, Trillions, and Zillions.


                                                 JOHN
                               (gazing around their magnificent home)

        Yes, and then I lost my inheritance. But we both worked very hard over the years to
        make our dreams come true. And they did, didn’t they, my little Trotskyite?


    This exchange tells the audience seven fictional facts: This couple is
rich, they are in their forties, they met within the elite of their university, he
was born to a wealthy family, she came up from poverty, they once had
opposite political views but no longer, and over the years they’ve developed
a banter that’s so sweet it hurts your teeth.
    The scene is false and its dialogue tinny because the writing is dishonest.
The characters are not doing what they seem to be doing. They seem to be
reminiscing, but in fact they’re mouthing exposition so the eavesdropping
audience can overhear it.
    As mentioned above, prose writers can avoid these fake scenes by
sketching a brief marital history that strings facts together with a pleasing
style. If they wish, prose writers can, within limits, simply tell their readers
what they need to know. Some playwrights and screenwriters ape novelists
by resorting to narration, but with rare exceptions, direct address onstage
and voice-over onscreen cannot mete out exposition with the intellectual
power and emotional impact of fully dramatized dialogue.
    To make this point for yourself, do an exercise in exposition as
ammunition. Rewrite the scene above so that the two characters use their
expositional facts as weapons during a fight in which one character forces
the other to do something that he or she does not want to do.
    Now do it again. But this time, put the same facts into a seduction scene
in which one character uses what he or she knows as ammunition to subtly
manipulate the other into doing something the other does not wish to do.
    Write the scene so that the exposition becomes invisible and the
characters’ behaviors credible. In other words, write it so that the conflict or
seduction fascinates the reader/audience, and the exposition they need to
know slips unawares, invisibly, as it were, into their minds.


CHARACTERIZATION

The second function of dialogue is the creation and expression of a
distinctive characterization for each character in the cast.
    Human nature can be usefully divided into two grand aspects:
appearance (who the person seems to be) versus reality (who the person
actually is). Writers, therefore, design characters around two corresponding
parts known as true character and characterization.
    True character, as the term implies, names a character’s profound
psychological and moral being, a truth that can only be revealed when life
backs the character into a pressure-filled corner and forces him to make
choices and take actions. The Principle of Choice is foundational to all
storytelling, fictional and nonfictional: to wit, a character’s true self can
only be expressed through risk-filled choices of action in the pursuit of
desire.
    Characterization denotes a character’s total appearance, the sum of all
surface traits and behaviors. It performs three functions: to intrigue, to
individualize, to convince.
    1) To intrigue. The reader/audience knows that a character’s appearance
is not her reality, that her characterization is a persona, a mask of
personality suspended between the world and the true character behind it.
When the reader/audience encounters a one-of-a-kind personality, they
listen to the character’s words and naturally wonder: “That’s who she seems
to be, but who is she really? Is she actually honest or a liar? Loving or
cruel? Wise or foolish? Cool or rash? Strong or weak? Good or evil? What
is the core identity behind her intriguing characterization? What is her true
character?”
    Having hooked the reader/audience’s curiosity, the story becomes a
series of surprising revelations that answer these questions.
    2) To convince. A well-imagined, well-designed characterization
assembles capacities (mental, physical) and behaviors (emotional, verbal)
that encourage the reader/audience to believe in a fictional character as if
she were factual. As the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge noted two centuries
ago, the reader/audience knows that stories and characters are not actual.
But they also know that to involve themselves in the telling, they must
temporarily believe, or more precisely, they must willingly suspend their
disbelief and accept the character’s actions and reactions without doubt,
without argument.
    If your reader/audience thinks the thought, “I don’t believe a word she
says” because they sense your character is a liar, that could be a revelation
of true character. But if they think the same thought because they don’t
simply believe in your character, then it’s time for a rewrite.
    3) To individualize. A well-imagined, well-researched characterization
creates a unique combination of biology, upbringing, physicality, mentality,
emotionality, education, experience, attitudes, values, tastes, and every
possible nuance of cultural influence that has given the character her
individuality. Moving through her days, pursuing career, relationships,
sexuality, health, happiness, and the like, she gathers behaviors into a one-
of-a-kind personality.
   And the most important trait of all: talk. She speaks like no one we have
ever met before. Her language style not only sets her apart from all other
cast members but also, if the writing is masterful, from all other fictional
characters. A recent example: Jeanette “Jasmine” Francis (Cate Blanchett)
in Woody Allen’s BLUE JASMINE. (Dialogue to characterize will be fully
explored in Chapters Ten and Eleven.)


ACTION

Dialogue’s third essential function is to equip characters with the means for
action. Stories contain three kinds of action: mental, physical, and verbal.
    Mental Action: Words and images compose thoughts, but a thought
does not become a mental action until it causes change within a character—
change in attitude, belief, expectation, understanding, and the like. A mental
action may or may not translate into outer behavior, but even if it stays
secret and unexpressed, the character who took the mental action is not
quite the same person afterward as she was before. Character change
through mental action impels much of modern storytelling.
    Physical Action: Physical action comes in two fundamental kinds:
gestures and tasks.
    By gestures, I mean all varieties of body language: facial expression,
hand movements, posture, touch, proxemics, vocalics, kinesics, and the
like. These behaviors either modify spoken language or substitute for it,
expressing feelings words cannot.1
    By tasks, I mean activities that get something done: working, playing,
traveling, sleeping, lovemaking, fighting, daydreaming, reading, admiring a
sunset, and the like—all those actions that do not require talk.
    Verbal Action: As novelist Elizabeth Bowen put it, “Dialogue is what
characters do to each other.”2
    On the level of outer behavior, a character’s dialogue style melds with
his other traits to create his surface characterization, but at the inner level of
true character, the actions he takes into the world reveal his humanity or
lack of it. What’s more, the greater the pressure in the scene (the more he
stands to lose or gain in that moment), the more his actions tell us who he
really is.
    What a character says, however, only moves the reader/audience if the
actions he takes beneath his lines ring true to that specific character in that
specific moment. Therefore, before writing a line, ask these questions:
What does my character want out of this situation? At this precise moment,
what action would he take in an effort to reach that desire? What exact
words would he use to carry out that action?
    Spoken words suggest what a character thinks and feels; the action he
takes beneath his words expresses his identity. To uncover a character’s
inner life, seek the subtextual action and label it with an active gerund (“-
ing”) phrase. Below are the four dialogue quotes from the preface. Look
into the subtext of each, and name the character’s action with a gerund.
When done, compare your interpretations to mine.

   Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow,
   Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
   To the last syllable of recorded time,
   And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
   The way to dusty death.
                                   —Macbeth in The Tragedy of Macbeth

   “Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world she walks into
   mine.”
                                               —Rick in CASABLANCA

   “Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to
   the last I grapple with thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s
   sake I spit my last breath at thee.”
                                                     —Ahab in Moby Dick

   “Not that there’s anything wrong with that.”
                                                   —Jerry in SEINFELD

    All four quotes above imply disgust, but Macbeth, Rick Blaine, Ahab,
and Jerry Seinfeld express their disdain in such radically different speech
styles that their personalities could not be more unalike. (Dialogue style as
the door to characterization will be the focus of Part Three.)
    My sense of the deep character under the four speeches suggests these
subtextual actions: Macbeth—denouncing existence; Rick Blaine—
lamenting lost love; Ahab—blaspheming God’s power; Jerry Seinfeld—
ridiculing the political correctness that protects asinine behavior from
ridicule. Your interpretations of implied action may differ from mine (not
that there’s anything wrong with that), but the purpose of this exercise is to
reveal the difference between the activity of talk and the taking of action.
    Part Four will further demonstrate this technique by parsing seven
scenes beat by beat to separate their outer language from their inner actions
and trace how these dynamic designs motivate what’s said as they arc
scenes around their turning points.

        EXPRESSIVITY I: CONTENT


                                   As You Like It, Act 2, Scene 7


                                      Jaques (to Duke Senior)

        All the world’s a stage,

        And all the men and women merely players:

        They have their exits and their entrances;

        And one man in his time plays many parts…

Jaques believes that in the theatre of life, everyone acts out his own cast of
characters decade after decade from infant to adult to geezer. Jaques steps
back to survey this pattern from a philosophical, objective, long-term,
outside-in, public point of view. But in order to create Jaques’s dark
doctrine, Shakespeare worked (my guess) from the reverse perspective—
psychological, subjective, here and now, inside-out, and profoundly private.
    As you compose dialogue, I think it’s useful to imagine character design
as three concentric spheres, one inside the other—a self within a self within
a self. This three-tiered complex fills dialogue with content of thought and
feeling while shaping expression in gesture and word. The innermost sphere
churns with the unsayable; the middle sphere restrains the unsaid; the outer
sphere releases the said.


THE SAID

The surface level of things said supports the more or less solid meanings
that words, spoken or written, directly express with both denotations and
connotations. “Snake,” for example, literally means “a legless reptile,” but
in Western culture it also symbolizes treachery and evil. The word “house”
connotes more than domicile. It carries overtones of home, hearth, and
family, plus undertones of shack, crash pad, and flophouse.
    This is why quotable dialogue such as “Get busy livin’ or get busy
dyin’” (Ellis Boyd “Red” Redding in THE SHAWSHANK
REDEMPTION) and “I’m just one stomach flu away from my goal weight”
(Emily Charlton in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA) outlive their stories and
their characters. These sentences express their meaning no matter who says
it or when.
    Word choices (busy dyin’, stomach flu) naturally enrich the lines with
connotations from the culture outside their fictional setting. But because a
specific character in a specific situation speaks the lines with a specific
purpose, a wholly new and deeper realm comes into play: the character’s
intelligence, imagination, and other genetic givens.
    By creating an original dialogue style of vocabulary, diction, syntax,
grammar, tone, tropes, and accent, the writer characterizes a role. Verbal
choices express the character’s education or lack of it, wit or lack of it, his
outlook on life, the range of his emotional behavior—all the observable
traits that jigsaw into a personality.


THE UNSAID

A second sphere, the unsaid, revolves within a character. From this inner
space the self gazes out at the world. As thoughts and feelings form at this
level, the self deliberately withholds them. Nonetheless, once the character
speaks (text), readers and audiences instinctively look past the words to
intuit the unsaid, to glimpse what the character actually thinks and feels
(subtext) but chooses not to put into words. The writer, therefore, must hone
dialogue so that this is possible, so that the unsaid can be sensed by
implication.1
    When Emily Charlton (Emily Blunt) says to Andy Sachs (Anne
Hathaway) “I’m just one stomach flu away from my goal weight,” what she
does not say, but we know she is thinking, might go something like this:
“The fashion world forces me to live an anorexic life, but I want my career
more than my health. Perpetual hunger is a price I’m happy to pay. If you
value your job future, you will do the same.”
    Novels thrive at the level of the unsaid. In Chapter One of Ian
McEwan’s Enduring Love, a violent accident kills a man. In the next
chapter, as Joe Rose stands among the other survivors, surveying the
aftermath, he confides to the reader:

   Clarissa came up behind me and looped her arms around my waist
   and pressed her face into my back. What surprised me was she was
   already crying (I could feel the wetness on my shirt) whereas to me,
   sorrow seemed a long way off. Like a self in a dream I was both first
   and third persons. I acted, and saw myself act. I had my thoughts,
   and I saw them drift across a screen. As in a dream, my emotional
   responses were nonexistent or inappropriate. Clarissa’s tears were no
   more than a fact, but I was pleased by the way my feet were
   anchored to the ground and set well apart, and the way my arms were
   folded across my chest. I looked out across the fields and the thought
   scrolled across: That man is dead. I felt a warmth spreading through
   me, a kind of self-love, and my folded arms hugged me tight. The
   corollary seemed to be And I am alive. It was a random matter, who
   was alive or dead at any given time. I happened to be alive.


THE UNSAYABLE

Deepest yet, concealed beneath the unsaid, the sphere of the unsayable roils
with subconscious drives and needs that incite a character’s choices and
actions.
    A character’s truest nature can only be expressed when, under the
pressures of life, he chooses to act in pursuit of a life-defining desire. As
antagonistic pressures build greater and greater power, the character’s
choices of action reveal his hidden self, until a final choice under the
maximum pressure of life exposes the character’s primal, irreducible self.
How deliberate versus instinctive the motivations are that propel human
choice of action has been debated for centuries. But whatever the case,
choices begin in this innermost sphere.
    Language, therefore, cannot express who a character actually is, only
who he seems to be. As the Bible teaches, a person is known not by his
words but his deeds. The truth comes full circle, however, once the writer
realizes that words are deeds.
    Talk is the foremost vehicle for human action. When a character says
something, he is, in fact, doing something. By speaking, he could be
comforting a loved one, bribing an enemy, begging for help, refusing to
help, obeying authority, defying authority, paying the price, remembering
the day, and so on down the limitless list of human actions. Dialogue
expresses far more than the meanings of its words. As language, dialogue
conveys characterization, but as action, dialogue expresses true character.
    Moment by moment, your character struggles in pursuit of her desires;
she takes actions and uses her spoken words to carry them out. At the same
time, however, her language choices convey her inner life, conscious and
subconscious, without announcing it. Whether read or acted, fine dialogue
creates a transparency that allows the reader/audience to gaze through the
text of talk. This phenomenon turns the story-goer into a mind reader.
    When you read a page of expressive dialogue or watch a fine actor
perform a complex scene, your sixth sense invades the character. You
become a telepathist, often better aware of what’s going on inside her than
she knows herself. Your story-trained sonar traces vibrations down through
the character’s subconscious currents, until the actions she takes in the
subtext of her lines enunciate her identity and you discover her profound
personal dimensions.
    If, as some people believe, anything and everything can be expressed in
words, we should stop telling stories and write essays instead. But we don’t,
because at the rock bottom of being, the unsayable energies in the
subconscious mind are real and demand expression.
    Dialogue unites these realms because the spoken word resonates through
all three spheres. Dialogue wields the double power to express the effable
(characterization) while it illumines the ineffable (true character)—what can
be put into words versus what can only be put into action. Dialogue,
therefore, is the writer’s foremost vehicle for character content.


ACTION VERSUS ACTIVITY

The axiom “nothing is what it seems” expresses the primal duality of life:
What seems is the surface of life, the activity we see and hear, the outer
behavior of what a character says and how she behaves. What is is the
substance of life, the action the character takes below the surface of activity.
    Outer goings-on such as playing cards, working out, sipping wine, and,
most of all, talking are simply activities. These textual behaviors mask the
truth of what the character is actually doing. For even though an activity
like chatting with a stranger at a bus stop may seem without purpose, it
never is. Therefore, no line of dialogue is finished until you’ve answered
this question: In the subtext of my character’s verbal activity, what action is
he in fact taking?
    Consider ice cream. We never eat ice cream simply because we’re
hungry. Like all behaviors, a conscious or subconscious action underlies
this activity. What is the ice cream eater really doing? Perhaps he’s
drowning his sorrows in something sweet or rebelling against doctor’s
orders or rewarding himself for sticking to his diet. Those actions—
drowning sorrows, rebelling, or rewarding—find expression in the activity
of eating ice cream.
    The same of talk. As Character A and Character B converse, what are
they doing? Are the words Character A uses consoling Character B or
ridiculing her? When B reacts, does her dialogue suggest that she is
submitting to A or dominating him? Is A feigning interest or falling in love?
Is B deceiving A or confessing to him? And on the questioning goes.
Behind the textual activities of the characters, what subtextual actions
actually drive the scene?
    An activity, therefore, is simply the surface manifestation of an action;
it’s the way a character carries out an action. Action is foundational to
storytelling, and every activity contains one.
    “Drama” is the ancient Greek word for action, derived from the verb
draoō, meaning “to do” or “to act.” The audiences of classical Greece knew
that no matter what was happening on the surface of a play, an inner action
drives all outer activity. Extending this principle to the writing of a scene,
we realize that even silence has underlying action. Not speaking when a
situation calls for talk is an action, perhaps a cruel one, aimed at another
person. When a character speaks, he is doing something: helping or hurting,
begging or bribing, persuading or dissuading, explaining or misleading,
attacking or defending, complimenting or insulting, complaining or
thanking, and so on down an endless list of actions. Even pauses play into a
beat of action/reaction: When a character pauses, she’s either reacting to the
scene’s previous action or preparing her next move.
    The term “dialogue” is often contrasted with “monologue,” as if
dialogue were always a two-way process. But that’s misleading. As I
mentioned in Chapter One, dialogue is a contraction of two Greek terms
(dia and legein) meaning “through” and “speak.” “Dialogue” connotes
actions taken through talk. Therefore, when a character talks to herself, she
takes action within herself. “Monologue” connotes someone talking to no
one or nothing, but in reality, that’s impossible. Someone, something, or
some aspect of the self is on the receiving end of every word ever spoken or
thought.


TEXT AND SUBTEXT

Activity and action run parallel to another pair of terms: text and subtext.
   Text means the surface of a work of art and its execution in its medium:
paint on canvas, chords from a piano, steps by a dancer. In the art of story,
text names the words on the page of a novel, or the outer life of character
behavior in performance—what the reader imagines, what an audience sees
and hears. In the creation of dialogue, text becomes the said, the words the
characters actually speak.
   Subtext names the inner substance of a work of art—the meanings and
feelings that flow below the surface. In life, people “speak” to each other, as
it were, from beneath their words. A silent language flows below conscious
awareness. In story, subtextual levels enclose the hidden life of characters’
thoughts and feelings, desires and actions, both conscious and subconscious
—the unsaid and unsayable.
    Skillful dialogue creates a kind of transparency. The text of a character’s
spoken words conceals her inner life from other characters, while at the
same time allowing the reader/audience to see through the surface of her
behavior. Adept dialogue delivers the sensation of insight, the sense of
reading a character’s mind and knowing what she is really thinking, really
feeling, really doing to the point of understanding her inner life better than
the character herself.
    We who live in the word-centric culture of European heritage tend to
believe that language sets the limits of experience. While there can be no
doubt that language molds thinking in subtle ways, a writer must come to
grips with how other modes of expression—the paralanguage of gesture and
facial expression, along with tone of voice, dress, movement, and the like—
influence a character’s experience of his inner self and outer life, and most
importantly, how he expresses himself with or without words.
    When, for example, Character A says to Character B: “Hi, how ya
doing? Oh look, you’ve lost weight!” On the text, Character A’s actions
greet and compliment Character B. But depending on the nature and history
of their relationship, in the subtext Character A could be doing anything
from encouraging to seducing to taunting to insulting Character B. The
possible subtextual actions under the most seemingly neutral expressions
are as varied as the beings who take them.
    Human nature constantly combines an outer behavior (text) with
subterranean selves (subtext). Those rare and rather strange people who put
their unsaid directly into their said seem mechanical, unreal, inhuman,
disconnected, even insane. Hitler, for example, had no subtext. Mein Kampf
was not a metaphor; it was a timetable for the holocaust. He stated his full
intentions in the text, but because his visions were too horrible to believe,
allied politicians spent the 1930s searching for consolation in a nonexistent
subtext.

            EXPRESSIVITY II: FORM


The qualities and quantities of dialogue vary with the levels of conflict used
in the storytelling.


THE CONFLICT COMPLEX

Conflict disrupts our lives from any one of four levels: the physical (time,
space, and everything in it), the social (institutions and the individuals in
them), the personal (relationships of intimacy—friends, family, lovers), and
the private (conscious and subconscious thoughts and feelings). The
difference between a complicated story and a complex story, between a
story with minimum dialogue versus maximum dialogue, hinges on the
layers of conflict the writer chooses to dramatize.
    The action genres put their protagonists up against physical conflict
almost exclusively. For example, J. C. Chandor’s film ALL IS LOST. On
the other hand, the novelistic technique of stream of consciousness
submerges the telling entirely at the layer of inner conflict. There, it churns
crosscurrents of dream and memory, of regret and yearning that flood the
protagonist’s mind. For example, Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway.
    Filmmakers like Chandor, who strive for a purity of objectivity, or
authors like Woolf, who seek a purity of subjectivity, complicate their
works at the extreme of only one level of conflict. As a result, their genius
crafts a compelling story with little or no need for spoken dialogue. Stories
told with highly kinetic concentration at just one level of life are
complicated, often dazzlingly so, but, in my definition, not complex.
    Complex stories embrace two, three, or even all four levels of human
conflict. Authors with worldviews both wide and deep often bracket their
tellings with inner conflict at one level, physical strife at another, and then
concentrate on the middle ranges of social and personal conflicts—the two
venues of talk.
    Personal conflicts embroil friends, family, and lovers. Intimacy, by its
nature, begins in talk, then builds, changes, and ends in talk. Personal
conflicts, therefore, roil with multilayered, multi-meaning dialogue.
    For example, this exchange between Walter White and his wife, Skyler,
in Season 4, Episode 6 of BREAKING BAD. From the first season’s first
episode on, Walter White’s characterization portrays a nervous, insecure,
defensive man. But by the end of this scene we glimpse his true character.

     INT. BEDROOM—DAY.
     Husband and wife sit on the bed.

                                                SKYLER
         I said before, if you are in danger, we go to the police.

                                                WALTER
         No, I don’t want to hear about the police.

                                                SKYLER
         I do not say that lightly. I know what it could do to this family, but if it is the only
         real choice we have, if it’s either that or you getting shot when you open your front
         door—

                                                WALTER
         —I don’t want to hear about the police.

                                                SKYLER
         You’re not some hardened criminal, Walt. You are in over your head. That’s what
        we tell them, that’s the truth.

                                             WALTER
        That’s not the truth.

                                             SKYLER
        Of course it is. A schoolteacher, cancer, desperate for money—

                                             WALTER
                                            (getting up)
        —We’re done.

                                             SKYLER
        —roped into working, unable to quit. You told me that yourself, Walt. Jesus, what
        was I thinking?
                                              (pause)
        Walt, please, let’s both of us stop trying to justify this whole thing, and admit
        you’re in danger.

    Walter slowly turns to her.

                                             WALTER
        Who are you talking to right now? Who is it you think you see?
                                              (pause)
        Do you know how much I make a year? Even if I told you, you wouldn’t believe it.
        Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going to work? A
        business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up.
        Disappears. It ceases to exist without me.
                                              (pause)
        No, you clearly don’t know who you’re talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in
        danger, Skyler. I am the danger. A guy opens a door and gets shot. You think that’s
        me? No, I am the one who knocks.

    He walks out of the bedroom; Skyler stares after him.

   Walter is describing his new, other self, the doppelgänger we come to
know as Heisenberg. Skyler, dumbfounded by her husband’s words, can
only grasp for the meaning.
    Social conflicts surge through institutions of public purpose: medical,
educational, military, religious, governmental, corporate—all societal
enterprises, legal and criminal. As people move from personal to social
relationships, they often speak with less sincerity and greater formality.
When public conflicts peak, characters break into speeches.
    Consider this example from HOUSE OF CARDS. A political operative
rejects a proposal from Frank Underwood. As the operative walks off,
Frank turns to camera with this aside:

                                              FRANK
        Such a waste of talent. He chose money over power. In this town a mistake nearly
        everyone makes. Money is the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after
        ten years; power is the old stone building that stands for centuries. I cannot respect
        someone who does not see the difference.

    To generalize: The more physical and social a story’s conflicts, the less
the dialogue; the more personal and private the conflicts, the more the
dialogue.
    Therefore, to create a complex story, the writer must master the double
dimension of dialogue—the outer aspect of what is said versus the inner
truth of what is thought and felt. When first spoken, a line of dialogue
conveys a surface meaning, the meaning the speaker hopes other characters
will believe in and act on. This first meaning seems logical in its context,
conveys a sense of character purpose and tactic, and arouses curiosity as we
glance across the scene to see its effect. The language itself may also
delight us with tropes or wordplay, especially when written for the stage. In
the next moment, however, this solid speech seems to dissolve, and we
sense a second, deeper meaning hidden behind the words.
    Thanks to our powers of intuition and perception, character-specific
dialogue inspires a sudden insight into the character’s ineffable inner self,
his unseen needs and desires. True-to-character talk lets us read past
conscious thoughts and sense unspoken feelings down to a character’s
subconscious urges. This effect is so powerful that the fullness and depth of
insight we have into fictional characters often surpasses what we glimpse in
the living people around us.
    Dialogue, at its best, hangs suspended between a character’s public face
and her secret self. Like multifaceted crystals, her spoken words refract and
reflect aspects of her inner and outer lives. Because personal and social
lives begin, evolve, and end through talk, the complex relationships and
conflicts between human beings cannot be fully dramatized without
expressive, character-specific dialogue.
    Inept dialogue, on the other hand, not only rings false, but also shallows
out the characters who speak it. Weak dialogue suffers from many faults
such as poor word choices, but the root cause runs much deeper:
                   Dialogue problems are story problems.
    With almost algebraic symmetry, the worse the storytelling, the worse
the dialogue. And because stories are so often hackneyed, we suffer
dissonant dialogue in countless films and plays and on hundreds of TV
channels. The same is true of the novel. Although modern prose often
speeds the read with page after page of dialogue, when was the last time
you were deeply moved by a chapter of talk? The majority of dialogue
published or performed is serviceable at best and instantly forgotten.
    We’re drawn to stories not only because they reflect the life around us,
but also because they illuminate the life within. One of the great pleasures
of story is staring, self-absorbed, into the mirror of fiction. Dialogue shows
us how we lie to others, how we lie to ourselves, how we love, how we beg,
how we fight, how we see the world. Dialogue teaches us what could or
should be said in life’s harshest or most rapturous moments.


DIALOGUE ONSTAGE

The stage is a symbolic space. From that moment untold millennia ago
when the first actor stood up to perform a story for his tribe, audiences have
instinctively understood that what is said and done in that precious space
means far more than words and gestures.1
    The stage puts the artificiality of art on open display. In the ritual of
theatre, actors act out fictional people in the living presence of other people,
everyone breathing the same air, all the while pretending that this unreality
is, for the moment, real. By taking her seat, the theatergoer signs an implicit
contract with the playwright: He may turn the onstage space into any world
he imagines, symbolic of whatever meaning he wishes to express; she in
turn will suspend her disbelief and react to his characters as if they were
living their lives in front of her.
    Are there limits to the “as if” convention? Apparently not. Since the
advent of Dada over a century ago, audiences have signed on for the wildest
rides, embracing surrealist plays such as André Breton’s If You Please
(1920), Theatre of the Absurd pieces such as Eugène Ionesco’s anti-play
The Bald Soprano (1950), the fragmentations of the Furth and Sondheim
concept musical Company (1970), and the literally hundreds of avant-garde
plays performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe every August.
    The “as if” conspiracy between author and audience licenses
playwrights to write dialogue at heights and depths of sublimity no human
being has ever actually spoken. From the master dramatists of classical
Greece, through Shakespeare, Ibsen, and O’Neill, to contemporaries like
Jez Butterworth, Mark O’Rowe, and Richard Marsh, playwrights have used
imagistic language and verse rhythms to intensify dialogue with poetic
force. And the audience listens because in the theatre we want to hear first,
see second.
    What’s more, the stage inspires the constant exploration and reinvention
of language. When Shakespeare couldn’t find the word he wanted, he made
one up: barefaced, obscene, eyeball, lonely, zany, gloomy, gnarled, bump,
elbow, amazement, torture, and over 1,700 other words are Shakespeare’s
invention.
    From the naturalistic barroom grit of Eugene O’Neill’s The Iceman
Cometh to the poetic elegance of T. S. Eliot’s Murder in the Cathedral, the
spectrum of language in the theatre is unmatched in the other media of
story.
    For example, consider the coffee table talk in Yasmina Reza’s play God
of Carnage as translated by Christopher Hampton. Two couples begin the
evening discussing a playground fight between their children. Their
civilized conversation, lubricated with alcohol, descends into ugly truths
about their marriages. In the dialogue below, both wives use sharp “as if”
similes to belittle their husbands.

     MICHAEL: Drinking always makes you unhappy.
     VERONICA: Michael, every word that comes out of your mouth is destroying me. I don’t
     drink. I drank a mouthful of this shitty rum you’re waving about as if you were showing
     the congregation the Shroud of Turin. I don’t drink and I bitterly regret it. It’d be a relief
     to be able to take refuge in a little drop at every minor setback.

     ANNETTE: My husband’s unhappy as well. Look at him. Slumped. He looks as if
     someone left him by the side of the road. I think it’s the unhappiest day of his life.2

   Now compare the phlegmatic ridicule of these two wives to this vibrant
speech from Blood Wedding (1933) by Federico García Lorca, translated by
Fernanda Diaz. As a servant sets the table for a wedding, she warns the
bride of a coming tragedy, spinning trope upon trope:
                                               SERVANT:
         For the wedding night
         let the warping moon
         part the black leaves
         and gaze down
         from her white window.
         For the wedding night
         let the frost burn,
         let the acid almond
         turn sweet as honey.
         O exquisite woman
         your wedding night nears.
         Tighten your gown, hide
         beneath your husband’s wing.
         He is a dove
         with a breast of fire.
         Never leave the house.
         The fields wait for the cry
         of eloping blood.

   To the ancient “as if” convention of the legit theatre, the musical theatre
adds yet another glaze, transfiguring the poetics of spoken lines into lyrics
and arias that heighten emotion the way dance enhances gesture. Indeed, all
the principles and techniques of dialogue discussed in this book apply to
musical theatre. From the recitativo of opera to the sung-through scenes of
the modern musical, characters who sing and dance vocalize dialogue into
music. Songs are simply another form of in-character talk.
    Theatre audiences hold to their belief in the “as if” so long as the play
creates an internally consistent setting in which characters talk (or sing) in a
manner that seems true to their world and to themselves; in other words, as
long as dialogue stays in-character. For without credibility, stories risk
billowing into meaningless, emotionless spectacles.


DIALOGUE IN FILM

A camera can fly through 360 degrees of global reality, devouring every
object, shape, and color in its path. Anything a writer can dream, CGIs can
duplicate beyond his dreams. Because the big screen foregrounds images
and backgrounds sounds, film audiences instinctively absorb the story
through their eyes, while they half listen to the score, sound effects, and
dialogue.
    In fact, for some cinema purists, the ideal film would be wordless. I
appreciate their aesthetic, but while it’s true that moving moments in film
are often mute, when I compare the best silent films with the finest sound
films, for me, stories told with audible dialogue win hands down. The
image of Thelma and Louise driving over a cliff into the Grand Canyon
shines vividly in my memory, but as I recall, they were shouting a joyful
“Keep going!” as they did. Without that line, the impact of their suicide
would have been halved.
    Although storytelling on the big screen clearly favors image over
language, the balance varies greatly from genre to genre. An
Action/Adventure film, such as ALL IS LOST, is told with no dialogue,
whereas an education plot, such as MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, is told in
all dialogue.
    The greatest difference between the screen versus stage and page,
therefore, is not the quantity of dialogue but the quality. The camera and
microphone so magnify and amplify behavior, that every phony glance,
every false gesture, every affected line looks and sounds more amateur than
the worst dinner party charade. Screen acting calls for a naturalistic,
believable, and seemingly offhanded technique. To make this possible,
screen dialogue must feel spontaneous. When forced to deliver ornamented
dialogue, even the finest actors sound ludicrous, cueing the audience to
react with “People don’t talk like that.” This holds true in all genres,
realistic and nonrealistic, in television and film.
   There are, of course, exceptions.

One: Stylized Realism
Realism bends with a certain elasticity. Setting a story in an unfamiliar
world allows the writer to enhance dialogue with greater figurative
language than a commonplace location, but the talk must still stay within
the realm of believability that the story’s world sets for itself. A film or
television series in a foreign setting (THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL
and HOMELAND), a criminal society (PULP FICTION and
DEADWOOD), a regional culture (BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD
and JUSTIFIED), or the distant past (SPARTACUS and VIKINGS) can take
dialogue well beyond the everyday, so long as it maintains credibility
within its self-imposed limits.
    In these exotic cases consistency becomes a problem. The writer must
be able to sustain an eccentric yet believable style over a full-length film or
even long-form television series such as THE WIRE. No easy task.

Two: Nonrealism
Genres of nonrealism (science fiction, musical, animation, fantasy, horror,
and farce) tend to tell allegorical stories, acted out by archetypal or
symbolic characters. In these genres, audiences not only accept but also
enjoy highly stylized dialogue. Think of THE MATRIX, 300, CORPSE
BRIDE, THE LORD OF THE RINGS, DR. SEUSS’ THE CAT IN THE
HAT, GAME OF THRONES, or GLEE.

Three: Extreme Characters
In life, some people outfeel, outthink, and outtalk the people around them.
Such characters deserve and should get imaginative, one-of-a-kind
dialogue.
   Suppose you were writing for extreme characters such as Walter White
(Bryan Cranston) in BREAKING BAD; Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny
Depp) in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN; Melvin Udall in AS GOOD
AS IT GETS, Jimmy Hoffa in HOFFA, or Frank Costello in THE
DEPARTED (all played by Jack Nicholson); or Sophie Zawistowski in
SOPHIE’S CHOICE, Suzanne Vale in POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE,
or Margaret Thatcher in THE IRON LADY (all played by Meryl Streep).
Excellent writers gave these bigger-than-life characters image-rich language
that attracted actors who knew what to do with it.
   Consider these two characters: Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) and
Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Bacall) from THE BIG SLEEP (1946). William
Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman adapted the film from
Raymond Chandler’s novel. In Hollywood jargon, the film is a crimedy, the
merger of two genres: crime story and romantic comedy. Repartee and
mimicry leaven the intrigue and gunplay. In one sequence, for example,
Marlowe, a private detective, pretends to be a gay rare book collector.
   In the scene below, Marlowe meets his client’s daughter, Vivian. The
two use racehorses as metaphors for themselves, and horse racing as a
metaphor for sex. Their flirtation characterizes them as quick-witted,
worldly-wise, self-assured, amusing, and mutually attracted. (To “rate” a
Thoroughbred means to restrain the horse early in a race in order to
conserve its energy for the finish.)

                                              VIVIAN
        Speaking of horses, I like to play them myself. But I like to see them work out a
        little first to see if they’re front-runners or come from behind, find out what their
        hole card is, what makes them run.

                                             MARLOWE
        Find out mine?

                                              VIVIAN
        I think so. I’d say you don’t like to be rated, you like to get out in front, open up a
        lead, take a little breather in the backstretch, then come home free.
                                               MARLOWE
        You don’t like to be rated yourself.

                                                VIVIAN
        I haven’t met anyone yet who could do it. Any suggestions?

                                               MARLOWE
        Well, I can’t tell till I’ve seen you over a distance of ground. You got a touch of
        class but… I don’t know how far you can go.

                                                VIVIAN
        That depends on who’s in the saddle.

                                               MARLOWE
        There’s one thing I still can’t figure out.

                                                VIVIAN
        What makes me run?

                                               MARLOWE
        Uh-huh.

                                                VIVIAN
        I’ll give you a little hint. Sugar won’t work. It’s been tried.

    When writing for the screen, even within the most fantasied genres,
always write for the actor. Language knows no limits, but acting does. Once
your work is in production, an actor will have to act your lines with clarity
and conviction. Therefore, what’s said must be kept within the realm of
what’s actable. This demand leads to a major difference between dialogue
for the stage versus the screen: improvisation.
    In the theatre, the playwright owns the play’s copyright. As a result,
actors may not improvise or paraphrase dialogue without the author’s
permission. In film and television, however, the writer assigns copyright to
the production company, so that when the need arises, directors, editors, and
actors can cut, change, or add dialogue. The professional reality of writing
for the screen is that the script you write may not be performed verbatim as
you wrote it. As a result, sadly, an actor’s improvisations may diminish
your work.
   Inept improvisations are easy to spot. When spontaneity blears and
actors lose track, they often buy time by repeating each other’s cues until
the scene sounds like an echo chamber:
                                              ACTOR A
        I think it’s time for you to leave.

                                              ACTOR B
        So you want me to leave, huh? Well, I’m not going anywhere until you listen to
        what I have to say.

                                              ACTOR A
        I’ve listened to everything you have to say and none of it makes sense.

                                              ACTOR B
        Sense? Sense? You want me to make sense? What did I say that didn’t make sense?

    And on they ramble.
    In rare cases, however, such as Robert DeNiro’s “You talkin’ to me?”
riff in TAXI DRIVER, an actor’s improvisation eclipses the script. In
FORREST GUMP, for example, Forrest (Tom Hanks) joins the army and
befriends fellow enlistee Bubba Blue (Mykelti Williamson). During a
montage of their boot-camp labors, Williamson improvises this passage as
transcribed from the screen:

   Bubba Blue: Anyway, like I was sayin’, shrimp is the fruit of the
   sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it. Dey’s uh,
   shrimp kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan-fried, deep-fried,
   stir-fried. There’s pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp,
   pepper shrimp, cave shrimp, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and
   potatoes, shrimp burger, cave shrimp. That– that’s about it.”

    Notice that Williamson used “cave shrimp,” a colorless crustacean found
in the subterranean streams of Alabama and Kentucky, twice. Even the best
of improvisations are prone to accidental repetition.
DIALOGUE ON TELEVISION

Comparing film to television, film (with exceptions) likes to take the
camera out-of-doors onto the streets and into nature; television (with
exceptions) gravitates toward indoor stories of families, friends, lovers, and
coworkers. For that reason, television tends to write more face-to-face
scenes, leaning the balance of dialogue versus image toward talk for three
reasons:
    1) The small screen. Facial expressions are hard to read in full-length
shots. This motivates the television camera to close in on a character’s face,
and when it does, that face talks.
    2) Genre. Television favors genres such as family comedy, family
drama, the love story, the buddy story, and professional dramas of all kinds
(cops, criminals, lawyers, doctors, psychologists, etc.). These series frame
personal relationships in homes and workplaces where intimacy begins,
changes, and ends first and foremost through talk.
    3) Small budgets. Image costs money, resulting in high film budgets.
Because dialogue is relatively inexpensive to stage and shoot, television’s
limited budgets encourage talk.
    Looking toward the future, if wall-mounted screens continue to grow in
size and popularity, TV budgets will also rise, causing a spike in
subscription fees. In time, large home screens will merge film and
television into one grand medium—the screen. On the other hand, when not
at home, people will consume stories on their iPads and iPhones, thus
keeping dialogue critical to the tellings. In either case, however, movie
theatres will close.


DIALOGUE IN PROSE

Prose translates conflicts from the private, personal, social, and physical
realms into word-pictures, often colored by the inner lives of characters,
before projecting them onto the reader’s imagination. Consequently, prose
writers pour their most vivid, high-intensity language into first-or third-
person narration rather than exchanges of dialogue. Indeed, free indirect
dialogue turns speech itself into narration. When prose writers do use direct
dialogue in dramatized scenes, they often restrict themselves to very
naturalist language in order to contrast the plainness of talk with the
figurative potency of their narration. With exceptions, such as Stephen
King’s Dolores Claiborne, many novelists and short-story writers use
quoted dialogue as a technique to simply change pace or break up blocks of
prose.
    The stage and screen confine dialogue to acted scenes and occasional
direct address that soliloquizes or narrates. Both media rely on actors to
enrich their characters with subtext and the paralanguages of tonality,
gesture, and facial expression. For that reason, an author’s expressivity in
the theatre or on film and television has to work within the possibilities of
the actor’s art. But because prose performs in the reader’s imagination, it
offers the writer the widest spectrum of dialogue styles.
    At one end of the continuum, prose creates conventional scenes that
could be transplanted directly to the stage or screen without changing a
word. In the middle ranges, the first-person voice becomes a novel-length,
uninterrupted speech composed of tens of thousands of words, all spoken to
the reader. Some authors turn away from the reader, as it were, and distill
thought into inner dialogues—secret conversations argued between the
many voices of a multifaceted self. Finally, at the far opposite edge of the
spectrum, third-person prose often eliminates quotation marks and
characterized voices altogether to subsume character talk into free indirect
dialogue.
    Chapter One looked at the three categories of point of view in prose and
how they affect the qualities and quantities of dialogue. Now, let’s take
those distinctions into more depth and detail by grouping the many varieties
of prose dialogue into two grand modes: in-character versus non-character.


Non-Character Narration
The non-character side of prose tells its stories through a third-person
narrator, an intelligence that is neither a character nor the real-life voice of
the author, but a guiding awareness a writer invents and then endows with
varying degrees of omniscience and objectivity to describe characters and
events as well as provide commentary in various kinds of discourse.
   A non-character narrator can present dialogue explicitly in dramatized
scenes or implicitly via narratized indirect dialogue. Consider this from the
short story “The Widow Predicament” by David Means:

   They sat across from each other at the Hudson House and conversed.
   His skin was weathered and he talked about Iceland most of the time
   until rising naturally out of his talk was the suggestion that perhaps
   she might want to see the country someday; nothing about dancing
   on the lip of volcanoes, or throwing themselves into one sacrificially,
   but a hint of it.3

    Indirect dialogue in non-character narration gives the writer the usual
assets of direct dialogue. It channels exposition when the reader needs to
know that the talk took place and the upshot of what was said. It
characterizes the speaker in terms of what the character talks about,
although not how he says it. And as in the example above, the narration that
surrounds indirect dialogue can express its subtext. Note how Means
describes subtext as something “rising naturally out of his talk,” and uses
the words “suggestion” and “hint” to convey a sense of ineffability.
    The two chief benefits of indirect dialogue in non-character narration are
1) acceleration of pace, and 2) protection against banality. The dinner table
talk about Iceland that Means summarized in a phrase could have gone on
for an hour. He saved us from that. And unless his character could describe
with a Hemingwayesque eye, Means knew best to leave landscape
adjectives off-page.
    The characterless voice of a third-person narration can be quite distant,
observant, and objective.
    For example, a Joseph Conrad narrator describes a tropical dawn:

   The smooth darkness grew paler and became blotchy with ill-defined
   shapes, as if a new universe were being evolved out of somber chaos.
   Then outlines came out, defining forms without any details,
   indicating here a tree, there a bush; a black belt of forest far off. The
   day came rapidly, dismal and oppressed by the fog of the river and
   the heavy vapors of the sky—a day without color and without
   sunshine: incomplete, disappointing, sad.

   When non-character awareness moves in the opposite direction and
becomes intimate, imitative, and subjective, it adopts a stream of
consciousness mode to invade the unsaid and unsayable realms and mirror a
character’s inner life. This technique mixes the third-person narrator’s
composure with the character’s emotional energies and word choices,
melding into the role, replicating her thought processes, generating the
impression of inner dialogue but without crossing the line to an in-character
voice.
   Consider, for example, this passage from Virginia Woolf’s novel Mrs.
Dalloway. Woolf’s non-character narrator uses words plucked from Clarissa
Dalloway’s vocabulary (“lark,” “plunge,” “something awful”) to emulate
the flow of memory:

   What a lark! What a plunge! For so it always seemed to her when,
   with a little squeak of the hinges, which she can hear now, she burst
   open the French windows and plunged into the open air. How fresh,
   how calm, stiller than this of course, the air was in the early morning;
   like the flap of a wave; the kiss of a wave; chill and sharp and yet
   (for a girl of eighteen as she then was) solemn, feeling as she did,
   standing there at the open window, that something awful was about
   to happen…

    Not all stream of consciousness “streams” with Virginia Woolf’s
breathless fluidity. Some interiorized passages zigzag or circle or pulse (see
the Ken Kesey and David Means examples below). For that reason, some
schools of writing use “stream of consciousness” and “inner dialogue”
interchangeably as if the terms were synonyms. But for the purposes of this
book, I give them distinct definitions. I draw the line with the answer to this
question: Who is talking to whom? Stream of consciousness uses a third-
person non-character voice to talk to the reader (as in the Woolf example
above); inner dialogue uses a character’s voice in first or second person to
talk to himself (as in the Nabokov example below).
The In-Character Voice
The in-character side of prose speaks with character-specific voices.
Dialogue, as I previously defined the term, includes all purposeful character
talk, whether spoken in duologues with other characters, said to the reader,
or by the character talking to herself. As we noted in Chapter One, because
prose does its acting in the reader’s imagination, it offers a far greater range
of in-character techniques than stage or screen. In-character prose employs
six tactics: 1) dramatized dialogue, 2) first-person direct address, 3) indirect
dialogue, 4) inner dialogue, 5) paralanguage, and 6) mixed techniques (see
Chapter Five for the last two tactics).

Dramatized Dialogue
In the novel, dramatized dialogue rarely reaches the intensity of a verse
play. Nonetheless, within the limits of genre and characterizations set by the
author, figurative language may enhance scenes, just as it does onstage and
onscreen. First-person narrators often enact “I said”/“she said”/“he said”
scenes, purely dramatized and without commentary.
    Robert Penn Warren’s All the King’s Men is narrated by Jack Burden, an
aide to a ruthless politician and the novel’s central character, Willie Stark,
a.k.a. the Boss. Stark needs a secret piece of dirt to smear the reputation of a
political foe, Judge Irwin. Note how Stark uses the decades that span from
diapers to the coffin as a metaphor for life:

   It all began, as I have said, when the Boss, sitting in the black
   Cadillac which sped through the night, said to me… “There is always
   something.”
       And I said, “Maybe not on the Judge.”
       And he said, “Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and
   he passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud.
   There is always something.”4


Direct Address
First-person narration is first cousin to soliloquys onstage and in-character
voice-overs onscreen. In all three cases a character speaks directly to the
person consuming the story. More often than not, the protagonist narrates
his or her story, but occasionally a supporting character does the talking.
Direct address can be more or less emotional, more or less objective, the
specific tone dependent on the personality of the narrator.
   Here, a Rudyard Kipling protagonist recalls looking out to sea and
describes the wide, calm, objective pleasure of his experience to the reader:

   I remember the windjammer as she sailed toward me. The setting sun
   ablaze astern. Out flung water at her feet, her shadow slashed rope
   furled sails bulging sideways like insolent cheeks of angels.

   Or, a first-person narrator’s view may contract, blinded by strong
emotions or lesser degrees of sanity. In Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the
Cuckoo’s Nest, a patient in a mental hospital, “Chief” Bromden, begins the
novel with:

   They’re out there. Black boys in white suits up before me to commit
   sex acts in the hall and get it mopped up before I can catch them.
   They’re mopping when I come out of the dorm, all three of them
   sulky and hating everything, the time of day, the place they’re at
   here, the people they got to work around. When they hate like this,
   better if they don’t see me. I creep along the wall quiet as dust in my
   canvas shoes, but they got special sensitive equipment to detect my
   fear and they all look up, all three at once, eyes glittering out of the
   black faces like the hard glitter of radio tubes out of the back of an
   old radio.5

    Bromden’s imaginings of unseen orgies and fear-detecting technology,
enriched with his metaphors (quiet as dust) and similes (faces like the hard
glitter of radio tubes) express his paranoid inner life, but at the same time,
give the impression that despite the Chief’s constricted, insane thoughts, he
is knowingly talking to us, the reader.


Indirect Dialogue
When a non-character third-person narrator uses indirect dialogue, subtext
often becomes text. For example, in the David Means scene above, his
third-person narrator tells the reader what was not said: “… nothing about
dancing on the lip of volcanoes, or throwing themselves into one
sacrificially, but a hint of it.”
    When in-character first-or second-person prose relates indirect dialogue,
subtext can only be implied because a first-person narrator doesn’t have
access to his own subconscious. For example, this scene from The Sense of
an Ending by Julian Barnes: Webster, the protagonist, wants to take action
against an ex-lover because she won’t give him a letter he believes is
rightfully his, so he consults a lawyer:

   Mr. Gunnell is a calm, gaunt man who doesn’t mind silence. After
   all, it costs his clients just as much as speech.
       “Mr. Webster.”
       “Mr. Gunnell.”
       And so we mistered one another for the next forty-five minutes,
   in which he gave me the professional advice I was paying for. He
   told me that going to the police and trying to persuade them to lay a
   charge of theft against a woman of mature years who had recently
   lost her mother would, in his view, be foolish. I liked that. Not the
   advice, but the way he expressed it. “Foolish”: much better than
   “inadvisable” or “inappropriate.”6

  The reader senses that beneath his glib approval of Gunnell’s choice of
words, Webster rages.

Inner Dialogue
Onstage and onscreen, the actor brings the unsaid to life within her
performance, where it stays mute in the subtext. But when novelists and
short-story writers wish, they can turn subtext into text and convert the
unsaid directly into literature. The chief difference, therefore, between in-
character direct address and inner dialogue is who’s listening. A first-person
voice narrates to the reader; an inner dialogist talks to himself.
  Lolita, for example, begins with Vladimir Nabokov’s protagonist,
Humbert Humbert, in self-celebration:

   Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta:
   the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to
   tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.

    Humbert is not talking to us. Rather, we sit outside, listening as his
inward-facing mind revels in memories. To capture this self-absorbed
admixture of sex and worship, Nabokov opens with metaphors for passion
as prayer, then focuses on Humbert’s tongue as it pounds “t” sounds in
alliteration.
    Compare Humbert’s masturbatory fantasy with a passage from “The
Knocking,” a short story by David Means. Means’s protagonist talks
directly to us as he reclines in his New York apartment, listening to the
tenant above him hang pictures or do repairs. His in-character voice guides
us through his hopscotching thoughts as they leap from now to then and
back to now.

   A piercingly sharp metallic tap, not too loud and not too soft, coming
   out from under the casual noise of summer afternoon—the roar of
   traffic on Fifth combined with high heel taps, taxi horns, and the
   murmur of voices—again, many of these knockings come late in the
   day when he knows, because he knows, that I’m in my deepest state
   of reverie, trying to ponder—what else can one do!—the nature of
   my sadness in relation to my past actions, throwing out, silently,
   wordlessly, my theorems: Love is a blank senseless vibration that,
   when picked up by another soul, brings form to something that feels
   eternal (like our marriage) and then tapers and thins and becomes
   wispy, barely audible (the final days in the house along the Hudson)
   and then, finally, nothing but air unable to move anything (the deep
   persistent silence of loss).

   Inner dialogue mimics free association to leapfrog through a character’s
mind. When we glance in the cracks between the images, we glimpse the
unsayable.
   To sum up: from stage to screen to page, the nature, need, and
expressivity of dialogue vary considerably. Stage dialogue is the most
embellished, screen dialogue the most concise, and prose dialogue the most
mutable.

    EXPRESSIVITY III: TECHNIQUE


FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE

Figurative devices range from metaphor, simile, synecdoche, and
metonymy to alliteration, assonance, oxymoron, personification, and
beyond. In fact, the list of all linguistic tropes and ploys numbers in the
hundreds. These turns of phrase not only enrich what’s said, but also send
connotations of meaning resonating into the subtexts of the unsaid and
unsayable as well.
   For example: In Scene Six of Tennessee Williams’s play A Streetcar
Named Desire, Blanche DuBois, a desperately vulnerable, aging Southern
belle on the edge of mental and emotional collapse, meets Mitch, a lonely,
sensitive, working-class bachelor who lives with his dying mother. After an
evening out, they confess to very different but equally pain-filled lives.
Their attraction builds to this moment:
        MITCH: (drawing Blanche slowly into his arms) You need somebody. And I need
        somebody, too. Could it be you and me, Blanche?

        She stares at him vacantly for a moment, then with a soft cry huddles in his
        embrace. She makes a sobbing effort to speak but the words won’t come. He kisses
        her forehead and her eyes and finally her lips. Her breath is drawn and released in
        long, grateful sobs.

                        BLANCHE: Sometimes—there’s God—so quickly.

     These five words condense tremendous meaning and emotion. The
phrase “there’s God” is not a metaphor comparing Mitch to a deity, but
rather hyperbole to express Blanche’s sense of an overwhelming, heaven-
like salvation. We suspect, however, that this epiphany is not her first.
     The words “Sometimes” and “so quickly” suggest that Blanche has been
rescued by men many times in the past. But the men who suddenly saved
her must have abandoned her just as fast because here she is, still
desperately alone, clinging to yet another stranger. In five words the
audience instantly glimpses the implied pattern: When Blanche meets men,
she plays the victim and inspires their inner white knight. They rescue her,
but then, for reasons we are yet to discover, desert her. Will Mitch be any
different?
     In one ear-catching trope, Tennessee Williams exposes the tragic
cadence of Blanche’s life and raises a dread-filled question in the audience’s
mind.
     Language composed into dialogue offers a spectrum that runs from
mental meanings at one end to sensual experiences at the other. For
example, a character might call a singer’s voice either “lousy” or “sour.”
Both terms make sense, but “lousy” is a dead metaphor that once meant
“covered with lice.” “Sour” still has life. The moment the audience hears
“sour,” their lips start to pucker. Which line stirs the most inner feeling:
“She walks like a model” or “She moves like a slow, hot song”? Dialogue
can express the same idea in countless ways, but, in general, the more
sensory the trope, the deeper and more memorable its effect.1
     Tropes work within a single sentence, but because dialogue dramatizes
conflict-filled talk speech after speech, temporal and counter-punctual
techniques also come into play: rapid rhythms versus silent pauses, run-on
sentences versus fragments, repartee versus argument, literate versus
illiterate grammars, monosyllabic versus polysyllabic vocabularies,
politeness versus profanity, verisimilitude versus verse, understatement
versus overstatement, and countless other examples of stylistics and
wordplay. Dialogue can dance to as many different tunes as life can sing.

I have emphasized the infinite array of creative possibilities that face the
writer a few times already and will again. I repeat this point because I want
writers to understand that form does not limit expression; it inspires it.
This book explores the forms that underlie dialogue but never proposes
formulae for writing it. Creativity is choice-making.


PARALANGUAGE

Actors provide their audiences with all forms of paralanguage, those
nonlexical nuances of voice and body language that enhance the meanings
and feelings of words—facial expression; gestures; posture; rate of words;
pitch, volume, rhythm, intonation, stress; and even proxemics, the distances
characters keep between themselves and others. An actor’s paralanguage
speaks a gesticulate dialogue. The eye of the audience reads these
microexpressions at up to one twenty-fifth of a second.2 On page, however,
paralanguage calls for description enhanced with figurative language.
    In this example from “Railroad Incident, August 1995,” a short story by
David Means, four homeless men sit around a fire at night when a half-
dressed man comes out of the shadows.

   What they saw emerge was a man softening into middle age. In his
   limp was a slight residue of dignity and formality, the way he lifted
   his feet as if they were still shod and weighted by the expensive
   shoes; or maybe all of that wasn’t noticed until, coming up to them,
   he opened his mouth and spoke, saying hello softly, the vowels
   widening, the cup of his mouth over those words like an expensive
   shell… 3

   (David Means writes short stories, I suspect, because his arsenal of prose
techniques is so diverse, he needs hundreds of tellings to explore them all.)


MIXED TECHNIQUES
Prose techniques can be used singularly or in concert. In this exchange from
An American Dream, Norman Mailer weaves three: direct dialogue, first-
person direct address, and paralanguage, both literal and figurative.

      “You want a divorce?” I said.
      “I think so.”
      “Like that?”
      “Not like that, darling. After all that.” She yawned prettily and
   looked for a moment like a fifteen-year-old Irish maid. “When you
   didn’t come by today to say goodbye to Deirdre—”
      “—I didn’t know she was leaving.”
      “Of course you didn’t know. How could you know? You’ve been
   nuzzling and nipping with your little girls.” She did not know that at
   the moment I had no girl.
      “They’re not so little any more.” A fire had begun to spread in
   me. It was burning now in my stomach and my lungs were dry as old
   leaves, my heart had a herded pressure which gave promise to
   explode.
      “Give us a bit of the rum,” I said.4

    A quick point about adaptation from medium to medium: If you wish to
adapt a prose story to the screen, recognize that novelists and short-story
writers tend to concentrate their finest language in the voices of their
narrators and not in the dialogue of their dramatized scenes—just as Mailer
did above.
    Literature resists filmic adaptation for the obvious reason: The camera
cannot photograph thought. Inner dialogues of concentrated prose cannot
shift sideways from page to screen. Therefore, to adapt you must reinvent.
You must re-envision the novel’s storytelling from the inside out, and
transform its novelistic narratized dialogue into filmic dramatized dialogue.
No small task.


LINE DESIGN
A line’s design pivots around its key term—the word or phrase essential to
its meaning. An author can place that key term first, last, or anywhere in the
middle. That choice results in one of three fundamental line designs:
suspenseful, cumulative, balanced.

The Suspense Sentence
Curiosity drives the thirst for knowledge—our intellectual need to solve
puzzles and answer questions. Empathy drives the hunger for connection—
our emotional need to identify with others and root for their well-being.
When the rational and emotional sides of life merge, they generate the
phenomenon of suspense. Suspense, simply put, is curiosity charged with
empathy.
   Suspense focuses the reader/audience by flooding the mind with
emotionally tinged questions that hook and hold attention: “What’s going to
happen next?” “What’ll happen after that?” “What will the protagonist do?
Feel?” And the major dramatic question (MDQ) that hangs suspended over
the entire telling: “How will this turn out?” These powerful questions so
grip our concentration that time vanishes. As events build to story climax,
suspense intensifies and peaks at the final and irreversible turning point that
answers the MDQ and ends the telling.
   This combination of curiosity and concern arcs the story’s overall
suspense, but when we zoom in for a close-up, we see that inquisitive
emotions permeate every story component, no matter its size. Each scene
dramatizes a suspense-filled turning point; each speech within the scene
grips interest from first line to last; even the smallest element of all, the line
of dialogue, shapes itself into a miniature unit of suspense. A superbly told
story holds unbroken intellectual and emotional involvement scene by
scene, speech by speech, line by line. The reader never pauses and the
audience never looks away, not for a moment.
   The key to composing dialogue that holds the eye to page and the ear to
the stage and screen is the periodic sentence. A periodic sentence
withholds its core idea until the final word. By front-loading the sentence
with modifiers or subordinate ideas and thus delaying the meaning to last,
the periodic sentence compels uninterrupted interest.
    For example: “If you didn’t want me to do it, why did you give me
that________?” What word would give that line its specific meaning?
“Look?” “Gun?” “Kiss?” “Nod?” “Photo?” “Money?” “Report?” “Smile?”
“E-mail?” “Ice cream sundae?” Almost any noun imaginable could nail the
meaning. To inspire intrigue, the periodic design makes meaning wait, and
thus compels the reader/audience to listen in wonder from the first word to
the last.
    In other words, the periodic sentence is the suspense sentence.
    For example, the opening scene from Art, a play by Yasmina Reza,
translated by Christopher Hampton. I have put the core word or phrase in
each sentence in bold.
    Marc, alone onstage.

        Marc: My friend Serge has bought a painting. It’s a canvas about five-foot by four:
        white. The background is white. If you screw up your eyes, you can make out
        some fine white diagonal lines.

        Serge is one of my oldest friends. He’s done very well for himself, he’s a
        dermatologist and he’s keen on art.

        On Monday, I went to see the painting; Serge actually got hold of it on the
        Saturday, but he’s been lusting after it for several months. This white painting
        with white lines.

    At Serge’s.

    At floor level, a white canvas with fine white diagonal scars. Serge looks at his painting,
    thrilled. Marc looks at the painting. Serge looks at Marc looking at the painting.

    Long silence: from both of them, a whole range of wordless emotions.

        Marc: Expensive?

        Serge: Two hundred thousand.

        Marc: Two hundred thousand?

        Serge: Huntington would take it off my hands for two hundred and twenty.
    Marc: Who’s that?

    Serge: Huntington?

    Marc: Never heard of him.

    Serge: Huntington! The Huntington Gallery!

    Marc: The Huntington Gallery would take it off your hands for two hundred and
    twenty?

    Serge: No, not the Gallery. Him. Huntington himself. For his own collection.

    Marc: Then why didn’t Huntington buy it?

    Serge: It’s important for them to sell to private clients. That’s how the market
    circulates.

    Marc: Mm hm…

    Serge: Well?

    Marc: …

    Serge: You’re not in the right place. Look at it from this angle. Can you see the
    lines?

    Marc: What’s the name of the…?

    Serge: Painter. Antrios.

    Marc: Well-known?

    Serge: Very. Very.

Pause.

    Marc: Serge, you haven’t bought this painting for two hundred thousand Euros?

    Serge: You don’t understand, that’s what it costs. In an Antrios.

    Marc: You haven’t bought this painting for two hundred thousand Euros?
        Serge: I might have known you’d miss the point.

        Marc: You paid two hundred thousand Euros for this shit?


    Serge, as if alone.

        Serge: My friend Marc’s an intelligent enough fellow, I’ve always valued our
        relationship, he has a good job, he’s an aeronautical engineer, but he’s one of those
        new-style intellectuals, who are not only enemies of modernism, but seem to take
        some sort of incomprehensible pride in running it down… 5


    Of the forty-five ideas expressed in these two soliloquies of narratized
dialogue and the scene of dramatized dialogue they bracket, forty are
shaped for suspense. Even the brief description of paralanguage (the
nonverbal facial expressions on Marc and Serge) delays its point until the
phrase “wordless emotions.”
    The suspense sentence is not only the most dramatic design but the most
comic as well. Almost all verbal jokes trigger laughter by ending on a
suspense sentence that suddenly severs its rising tension with a final punch
word. By saving the core word for last, Reza and Hampton energize their
lines, hold the audience’s interest, and concentrate impact into a single,
final, often comic punch.

The Cumulative Sentence
How old is the cumulative technique? Aristotle advocated it over 2,300
years ago. In Book Three, Part Nine of On Rhetoric, he examined the
differences between the tight, periodic suspense sentence and the loose,
free-running cumulative sentence. The two designs reverse mirror each
other: the suspense structure puts subordinate phrases first and ends on its
core word; the cumulative design puts its core word up front, then follows
with subordinate phrases that develop or modify the point.
    Consider the line design of Character B’s dialogue:

                                            Character A
        Remember Jack?
                                             Character B
                                               (nodding)
        Smoke circling his head like an angry halo, cigarette butt burning his lip, wrestling
        the spare, cursing the jack, trying to fix a flat…

                                         (with a sense of loss)
        … last time I ever saw him.

   When we reverse the design, this suspense sentence turns into a
cumulative sentence:

                                             Character A
        Remember Jack?

                                             Character B
                                         (with a sense of loss)
        I saw him, last time ever, trying to fix a flat, cursing the jack, wrestling with the
        spare, cigarette butt burning his lip, smoke circling his head like an angry halo.

   Although the free-running cumulative style may be less dramatic than a
suspense sentence, it is not slapdash. When well crafted, it paints an ever-
growing, more detailed picture of its subject. This snowballing quality gives
dialogue a conversational spontaneity while its phrases roll out with a
pleasing rhythm.
   The suspense design offers many advantages but drawbacks as well.
First, the meaning, constantly delayed, risks sounding contrived. Second, a
long suspense sentence may force the reader/audience to remember too
many pieces of a complex idea while waiting for the ending to pull the
thoughts together. If overwritten, a suspense sentence takes on the same
tedious feebleness of a badly built cumulative sentence.
   The suspense and cumulative designs sit at opposite ends of the
spectrum. Between opening a line with its core word versus closing with it
run countless variations.
   Parallel designs, for example, link phrases of similar length, meaning,
and design for contrast and emphasis:

   When I walked into that church, I walked into a new life.
The Balanced Sentence
The balanced sentence puts its core word(s) somewhere in the middle with
subordinate phrases on either side:

   Jack’s sex and gambling obsessions are high risk enough, but I think
   the guy must be an adrenaline junkie when I add his rock climbing
   and skydiving.

   The suspense sentence, straight or in parallel, is dialogue’s most
compelling and dramatic design. So for tension, emphasis, flourish, and
laughs, delay the core word. On the other hand, cumulative and balanced
sentences are the most conversational and free-running designs. But the
constant use of any single technique becomes as repetitious as wallpaper
and artificial as a robot. Therefore, to compel involvement and build
tension, while at the same time expressing a sense of characters living in the
moment and making up whatever they say, dialogue calls for a mixture of
designs.

Mixed Designs
In Season 1, Episode 3 of TRUE DETECTIVE, the co-protagonist, Rustin
Cohle, relates his worldview to Detectives Gilbough and Papania. Once
again, I bolded the core words. Note where each is located within its
sentence. (DB is cop-talk for dead body.)
                                         RUSTIN COHLE
        This… This is what I’m talking about. This is what I mean when I’m talkin’ about
        time and death and futility. All right there are broader ideas at work, mainly what
        is owed between us as a society for our mutual illusions. Fourteen straight hours of
        staring at DB’s, these are the things ya think of. You ever done that? You look in
        their eyes, even in a picture, doesn’t matter if they’re dead or alive, you can still
        read ’em. You know what you see? They welcomed it… not at first, but… right
        there in the last instant. It’s an unmistakable relief. See, ’cause they were afraid,
        and now they saw for the very first time how easy it was to just… let go. Yeah,
        they saw, in that last nanosecond, they saw… what they were. You, yourself, this
        whole big drama, it was never more than a jerry rig of presumption and dumb
        will, and you could just let go. To finally know that you didn’t have to hold on so
        tight. To realize that all your life, all your love, all your hate, all your memories, all
        your pain, it was all the same thing. It was all the same dream, a dream you had
        inside a locked room, a dream about being a person. And like a lot of dreams,
        there’s a monster at the end of it.

    Of the twenty-plus ideas Rust expresses, a dozen use suspense
sentences, and the rest are a mix of balanced, parallel, and cumulative
structures. As a result, this long passage hooks, builds, and pays off interest,
yet seems spontaneous, almost wandering. Note also how series creator and
writer Nic Pizzolatto caps Rust’s speech with a metaphor: Life is a dream.
Like a grace note that enhances a passage of music, a trope tagged on a
suspense sentence can add a mind-catching ornament.


ECONOMY

One final but critical quality of expressive dialogue is economy—saying the
maximum in the fewest possible words. All fine writing, especially of
dialogue, follows the principle of economy as laid down by William Strunk
Jr. and E. B. White in The Elements of Style: “Vigorous writing is concise.
A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no
unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no
unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not
that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and
treat his subjects only in outline, but that he make every word tell.”6
    Not vacuity, but economy.
    This principle became the Strunk and White imperative: “Omit needless
words.” Do your writing a favor and tape that dictate to your computer
screen, then do it. No speech, no matter its length, should ask the
reader/audience to absorb one more word than necessary. Extraneous
language annoys us. Omit it.
    (The dialogue in Sofia Coppola’s film LOST IN TRANSLATION
executes the principle of economy with perfection. See Chapter Eighteen.)
THE PAUSE

Inside the give-and-take of dialogue, the pause serves many uses. When
used prior to a turning point, a moment of wordless hesitation tightens
tension in the reader/audience, focuses their attention on what will happen
next, and emphasizes the gravity of the event. A pause after a turning point
allows the reader/audience time to absorb the meaning of the change and
savor its aftermath.
    A pre-crisis pause dams emotion momentum. In a well-written scene,
curiosity and concern flow toward the moment of critical change. The
reader/audience asks itself, “What’s going to happen next? What’s she
going to do when it does? How will this turn out?” As this impetus peaks, a
pause holds it in check and compresses its power. When the turning point
pivots, all that pent-up energy explodes into the scene’s climactic beat.
    Overused, however, the pause—like talk—can wear out its welcome.
The principle of economy applies as much to this tactic as any other. If
dialogue halts again and again and again to signal emphasis, emphasis,
emphasis, nothing gets emphasis. Like “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,” the
more often an author repeats a technique, the less effect it has. Then when
the scene arrives in which she wants the tactic to deliver its effect in full,
she discovers that repetition has blunted its edge.
    Be judicious in the placement of pauses. Shape the rhythm of scenes
without undo hesitation, so that when you put on the brakes, the standstill
moment grips attention. There are no free rests: A pause must be earned.


THE CASE FOR SILENCE

Lean, pacey dialogue, more implicit than explicit, keeps readers and
audiences hungry for more; stuffed, sluggish speeches, more explicit than
implicit, discourage interest. As overwritten dialogue wears on and on, the
reader skims, the audience stops listening. So, in the same way that tragic
scenes often call for comic relief, surplus talk may call for silence.
   From story to story, scene to scene, how much is too much is impossible
to say. Your taste and judgment must guide that decision. But if you feel
that your pages overtalk their scenes, switch gears and write for the eye
rather than the ear, make image substitute for language.
    Challenge yourself with this question: How could I write this scene in a
purely visual way, doing all that needs to be done for character and story
without resorting to a single line of dialogue? You can call upon the power
of images in one of two ways:
    One, paralanguage. Gestures and facial expressions are not, strictly
speaking, linguistic. Nonetheless, they can speak with all the overtones and
undertones of words. So rather than cluttering scenes with verbalized
affirmations or disaffirmations such as “yes/no,” “I agree/I disagree,” or “I
think you’re right/I think you’re wrong,” carry the moment with a nod, a
glance, a wave of the hand.
    This is especially true when writing for television and film. Whenever
possible, leave room for the screen actor’s creativity. Because the camera
can magnify a face many times larger than life, thoughts and emotions seem
to flow behind the eyes and under the skin like swells across a sea. Silence
invites the camera in. Use it.
    Two, physical action. At every opportunity ask yourself this question:
What physical, rather than verbal, behavior would execute my characters’
actions and reactions? Let your imagination paint word-pictures of doing
rather than saying.
    Consider, for example, a scene from a film by Ingmar Bergman with an
apt title in this context, THE SILENCE. In it, a woman in a hotel restaurant
allows herself to be seduced by a waiter. How to write that?
    Does the waiter offer her the menu, listing the specials of the day? Does
he recommend his favorite dishes? Does he compliment her on how she’s
dressed? Does he ask her if she’s staying at the hotel? Traveling far? Does
he ask if she knows the city? Does he mention he’s getting off work in an
hour and would love to show her the sights? Talk, talk, talk?
    Here’s how Bergman played it: The waiter, accidently on purpose, drops
a napkin on the floor next to her chair. As he slowly stoops and kneels to
pick it up, he sniffs and smells the woman from head to crotch to foot. She,
in reaction, inhales a deep, pleasure-filled sigh. Bergman then cuts to a
hotel room where the customer and waiter writhe in passion. Their intensely
erotic, visual, physical, wordless seduction in the restaurant executes its
turning point on her inhale.
Silence is the ultimate economy of language.

FLAWS AND FIXES
                        Introduction:


              SIX DIALOGUE TASKS


Effective dialogue executes six tasks simultaneously:

    1. Each verbal expression takes an inner action.
    2. Each beat of action/reaction intensifies the scene, building to and
       around its turning point.
    3. Statements and allusions within the lines convey exposition.
    4. A unique verbal style characterizes each role.
    5. The flow of progressive beats captivates the reader/audience,
       carrying them on a wave of narrative drive, unaware of the passage
       of time.
    6. The language strikes the reader/audience as authentic in its setting
       and true to character, thus maintaining belief in the story’s fictional
       reality.

    Fine dialogue harmonizes all six of these objectives at once, so let’s look
at the various faults that break the flow and cause discord.
                                     6


               CREDIBILITY FLAWS


INCREDIBILITY

The standards of credibility we set for the physical behaviors of characters
apply equally to what they say. Dialogue written for television, stage, or
film must inspire believable performances in its actors. Scenes written for a
novel or short story must inspire the reader to imagine credible behaviors in
literary characters. So, no matter how complex and compelling the
psychology of your characters, no matter how emotional and meaningful
your story design, if your characters do not talk in a manner true to their
natures, true to the setting and genre, the reader/audience loses faith.
Unconvincing dialogue destroys interest faster than sour notes destroy a
recital.
    Hollow, phony dialogue cannot be cured with naturalism. If you
eavesdrop on the conversations of your fellow passengers on planes, trains,
and buses, you realize in a flash that you would never put those gossipy bull
sessions on stage, page, or screen. Actual chatter repeats like a dribbling
basketball. Everyday talk lacks vividness, resonance, expressivity, and,
most critically, significance. Business meetings, for example, often roll on
and on, hour after hour, without metaphor, simile, trope, or imagery of the
least expressivity.
     The crucial difference between conversation and dialogue is not the
number, choice, or arrangement of words. The difference is content.
Dialogue concentrates meaning; conversation dilutes it. Therefore, even in
the most realistic settings and genres, credible dialogue does not imitate
actuality.
     In fact, credibility has no necessary relationship to actuality whatsoever.
Characters who live in impossible worlds, such as Alice’s Wonderland,
deliver lines that would never be said by a living person but are true to
themselves and true to the settings.
     In all settings from the most down-to-earth to the most magical, in all
genres from war stories to musicals, in all styles of speech from inarticulate
monosyllables to lyrical verse, dialogue should sound like the spontaneous
talk of its characters. For that reason, we gauge dialogue against a standard
of fictional authenticity, not factual accuracy. A character’s word choices
and syntax should not be so true to life that they imitate the redundant
banalities of the everyday. Rather, they must strike us as plausible and
vernacular within the context of the story’s world and genre(s).
     The reader/audience wants to believe that characters speak offstage, off-
page, or offscreen exactly as they speak onstage, on the page, or onscreen,
no matter how fantasized the story’s setting. Even in worlds as fantastic as
Guillermo del Toro’s film PAN’S LABYRINTH, as absurd as Eugène
Ionesco’s play Exit the King, as poetic as T. S. Eliot’s play Murder in the
Cathedral, or as archaic as Robert Graves’s novel, I, Claudius, the cast’s
talk need not be factual, but it must seem credible.
     On the other hand, anyone might say anything at any time. So, how do
we judge dialogue credibility? How do we know when a line is true to its
character and true to the moment, or false on both counts?
     Aesthetic judgment will never be a science. It is, by nature, as feeling as
it is thoughtful. Instead, you must rely on skilled intuition, on your sense of
rightness based on knowledge, experience, and inborn taste. Learn to judge
your dialogue by listening past the words and sensing the harmony or
disharmony between cause and effect. Dialogue rings true when a
character’s verbal actions resonate with his motivations, when his inner
desires and outer tactics seem to complement each other.
     Exactly how you will master judgment in your own work is yours to
discover, but to help guide you in that goal, below is a short list of faults
that damage credibility: empty talk, overly emoted talk, overly knowing
talk, overly perceptive talk, and excuses substituting for motivation.


EMPTY TALK

When a character speaks, the reader/audience looks into the subtext for a
motivation to make sense out of the lines, a cause to explain the effect. If
they find none, the dialogue sounds phony and the scene with it. The most
commonplace example: one character telling another character something
they both already know to satisfy the author’s expositional exigencies.


OVERLY EMOTIVE TALK

When a character uses language that seems far more emotional than his
actual feelings, again the reader/audience wonders why and checks the
subtext for an explanation. If they find none, they may assume that either
this hyper-dramatic character is a hysteric or that the author is desperately
trying to make too much out of too little. At some social/psychological
level, emotive dialogue and its context should complement each other.


OVERLY KNOWING TALK

Know what your characters know. Characters are an author’s creatures,
born of exhaustive research into the story’s setting and cast, countless
observations of human behavior, and ruthless self-awareness. A bold line,
therefore, runs between creator and created. Or should. But if a writer
crosses that line and injects his author’s knowledge into his character’s
awareness, we sense a cheat. When a character onscreen or onstage talks
about current events with a breadth and depth of understanding only his
author could have, or when a novel’s first-person protagonist looks back on
past events with factuality and clarity of insight beyond his experience,
again, the reader may sense that the author is whispering into his character’s
ear.
OVERLY PERCEPTIVE TALK

Similarly, beware characters who know themselves better than you know
yourself. When a character describes himself with a depth of insight more
profound than Freud, Jung, and Socrates combined, readers and audiences
not only recoil at the implausibility; they lose faith in the writer. Authors set
traps for themselves when they create characters with excessive,
unconvincing self-awareness.
    It happens like this: Hardworking writers fill notebooks and files with
character biographies and psychologies, generating ten or twenty times
more material than they would directly use in the writing. They do this, as
they must, to give themselves a surfeit of material in order to win the war
on clichés with original, unexpected choices. Having amassed this
knowledge, the desire to get all they know out into the world can become an
irresistible temptation. Unwittingly, the author crosses the line between
writer and character, turning his creation into a mouthpiece for his research.


EXCUSES MISTAKEN FOR MOTIVATION

Create honest motivation for behavior. In an effort to match a character’s
over-the-top action with a cause, writers often backtrack to the character’s
childhood, insert a trauma, and pass it off as motivation. Over recent
decades, episodes of sexual abuse became an overused, all-purpose, mono-
explanation for virtually any extreme behavior. Writers who resort to this
kind of psychological shorthand do not understand the difference between
excuse and motivation.
   Motivations (hunger, sleep, sex, power, shelter, love, self-love, etc.) are
needs that drive human nature and compel behavior.1 More often than not,
these subconscious drives go unrecognized, and as often as not, cause more
trouble than they cure. Unwilling to face the truth of why they do what they
do, human beings invent excuses.
   Suppose you were writing a pivotal scene for a political drama in which
a national leader explains to his cabinet why he is taking the country to war.
Throughout history, two primary motivations have driven one people to war
against another. First, the drive for power abroad. Land, slaves, and wealth
seized from the defeated empowers the victor. Second, the drive for power
at home. When rulers fear losing strength, they provoke war to distract their
citizens and regrip domestic power. (George Orwell dramatized both
motivations in his masterpiece, 1984.)
    These two motivations compel the reality of war, but no ruler who
declares war thinks like that. Or if he does, he would never say it. So, to
write your scene, you would have to bury motivation in the subtext, create a
leader with just the right quality of self-deception, and then write his
dialogue to frame an excuse other characters believe and follow.
    Some of the excuses warring peoples have used throughout history
include: “Saving souls for God” (Christian Crusades, Spanish Empire,
Ottoman Empire), “Shining the light of civilization into the darkness of
savagery” (British Empire), “Manifest Destiny” (genocide of Native
Americans), “Purifying the race” (the holocaust), and “Transforming
capitalist tyranny into Communist equality” (the Russian and Chinese
revolutions).2
    For an example of an excuse masquerading as motivation, consider
Shakespeare’s The Tragedy of Richard III. In Act 1, Scene 1, Richard, the
hunchbacked Duke of Gloucester, says that because his deformity is
repellent, he “cannot prove a lover.” So, instead he will “prove a villain”
and murder everyone between himself and the throne.
    Then, in the very next scene, Richard meets Anne, the beautiful widow
of a rival he recently assassinated. She hates Richard and curses him,
calling him the devil. Nonetheless, Richard, ugly as he is, guilty as he is,
mounts a campaign of brilliant psychological seduction. He claims that
because Anne is so breathtakingly beautiful and he is so desperately in love
with her, he had to kill her husband in the hopes of having her. He then
kneels down and offers her his sword so she can kill him, if she wishes. She
declines and by the end of the scene this blend of flattery and self-pity wins
her heart.
    With that seduction, Richard reveals himself as a masterful lover. So
why does he say he is not? Because he needs an excuse to mask his lust for
power.
    To write intriguing, layered, credible dialogue, first study the difference
between the two motors for human action—motivation and justification.
Then see if masking your characters’ subconscious drives with their
conscious efforts to excuse, or to at least make sense out of their
unexplainable behaviors, adds depth to their words.
   In most cases, false dialogue is not the signature of an overly confident,
overly knowledgeable writer, but the opposite: a nervous, unschooled
writer. Anxiety is the natural by-product of ignorance. If you don’t know
your character beyond his name, if you cannot imagine how he reacts, if
you cannot hear his voice, if you write in bewilderment, your hand will
scratch out nothing but bogus dialogue. In the fog of not knowing, you have
no other choice.
   Therefore, do the hard work. Surround your character with all the
knowledge and imagining you can. Test his traits against the people around
him and, most importantly, yourself. For at the end of the day, you are the
touchstone of truth. Ask yourself: “If I were my character in this situation,
what would I say?” Then listen with your most truth-sensitive ear for the
honest, credible answer.


MELODRAMA

The adjective “melodramatic” indicts writing for excessiveness—shrill
voices, lurid violence, tear-stained sentimentality, or sex scenes one shadow
this side of pornography. On the other hand, Shakespeare’s The Tragedy of
Othello rages with murderous jealousy; Sam Peckinpah’s THE WILD
BUNCH turns violence into cinematic poetry; Stephen Sondheim’s A Little
Night Music explores deep, painful sentiments; and Nagisa Oshima’s
masterpiece IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES indulges explicit sex; and
none of them is melodrama.
    Long before Oedipus gouged out his eyes, great storytellers have sought
the limits of human experience. Twenty-first-century artists continue this
quest because they sense that the depths and breadths of human nature
know no limits. Anything you can picture your characters doing, believe
me, human beings have already done it and in ways beyond imagining.
    The problem of melodrama, therefore, is not over-expression but under-
motivation.
    When a writer scores a scene with ping-ponging histrionics, trying to
make a snit seem lethal; when he cascades tears down a character’s face,
hoping to make a setback seem tragic; or when he forces behavior to exceed
what’s actually at stake in a character’s life, we dismiss his work as
melodrama.
    Melodramatic dialogue, therefore, is not a matter of word choices.
Human beings are capable of doing anything and saying anything while
they do it. If you can imagine your character talking in a passionate,
pleading, profane, or even violent way, then lift his motivation to match his
action. Once you have behavior balanced with desire, take it a step further
and ask yourself: “Would my character state or understate his action?”
    Compare two versions of a “Cut off his head!” scene: Suppose GAME
OF THRONES were to develop a plotline in which two kings fight each
other in a long war to a blood-soaked end. Then comes the climax: The
victorious king sprawls on his throne; his defeated enemy kneels at his feet,
awaiting sentencing. A courtier asks the king, “What are your wishes, sire?”
and the king screams his answer: “Smash every bone in his body! Burn his
skin black, peel it off, and feed it to him! Rip his eyes from his head and his
head from his neck.”
    Or, the courtier asks the king’s wishes, and as the victor examines his
manicure, he whispers, “Crucify him.”
    The subtext under “Crucify him” implies a death as hideous as the
screamed answer, but which answer conveys greater personal power? The
lurid, harsh, overstated rant, or the simple, understated “Crucify him”?
    Either answer could be perfectly in-character, but what kind of
character? The first answer implies a weak king at the mercy of his
emotions; the second suggests a powerful king in command of his
emotions. In the matter of melodrama, motivation and character are never
separate. What would drive one character over a cliff wouldn’t get another
character off his sofa. Therefore, the balance of motivation versus action is
unique to every role and has to be struck inside a character who first feels it
and then does it.

                 LANGUAGE FLAWS


CLICHÉS

Clichés are scenes we’ve seen too many times before, acted with
predictable behaviors, mouthed in dialogue we can recite before the actor
says a word.
    Like the weeds of repetition, clichés grow in the barren mind of the lazy
writer. Many wannabes assume that writing is easy, or it should be, so they
try to make it easy by rummaging through the trash of old stories, and
pulling out the same tired phrases we’ve heard or read a hundred times in
the same tired scenes we’ve heard or read a thousand times.
    Why lazy writers lack originality is no mystery, but why do diligent,
professional authors, who should know better, also resort to clichés?
Because they work. Once upon a time, today’s hackneyed expressions were
inspired creative choices.
    In CASABLANCA (1942), Captain Renault’s gem-quality imperative
“Round up the usual suspects” encapsulated political corruption in five
smart words. Since then, the phrase “the usual suspects” has topped the list
of the usual clichéd suspects in dozens of dictionaries devoted to clichés.1
    Somewhere in humanity’s past, a cave-dwelling storyteller first
described a teardrop in a character’s eye to express sorrow, and everyone
around the fire felt a wave of sadness. Once upon a time, a king’s raconteur
first compared an enemy’s military trap to a spider’s web, and the whole
palace felt a rush of fear. Although time has dulled the cliché’s edge, the
original invention was so sharp it still cuts a sliver of truth.
    Here, for example, is a short list of clichés that frequently find their way
into modern dialogue (to set a limit, I restricted the slate to phrases that
begin with the letters “ba”): backseat driver, back to basics, back to square
one, back to the drawing board, bad hair day, bag of tricks, ballpark figure,
ball’s in your court, bang your head against a brick wall, barking up the
wrong tree, battle royal… and the list goes on.
    Familiarity breeds comfort. People, on occasion, enjoy a cliché because
it signals cultural continuity. The past is still present. What people loved in
their childhood, they still love today. For that reason, clichés infect their
everyday talk. People use them because, trite or not, they make immediate
sense. As a result, the infrequent cliché adds verisimilitude.
    Just remember this: Sooner or later, every cliché reaches its use-by date
and becomes so odorous the world finally turns away in disgust.
    To create fresh, original dialogue, set high standards and never settle for
the obvious choice. Indeed, never settle for the first choice. Just write it
down, then improvise, experiment, go a little crazy, pour out as many
choices as your talent can create. Let your character say any off-the-wall
thing that comes into her head. By playing with every wild thing you can
imagine, you might discover that one of your lunatic choices is crazy but
brilliant.
    At the end of the day make your best choice, then cut the rest. No one
has to see your weak choices… unless you’re foolish enough to leave them
on the page.


CHARACTER-NEUTRAL LANGUAGE

Character-neutral dialogue substitutes generality for specificity.
   When writers use the stale language of everyday talk, they defend their
vapidities, once again, with appeals to verisimilitude. And again, they
would be correct. For when you turn an objective ear to the talk around you,
banalities and clichés do indeed echo and re-echo down the caverns of
conversation. In states of surprise, for instance, people call upon their
deities. “Oh my God!” naturally pops out of the startled. As dialogue,
however, this ready-made phrase robs the actor of a chance to create a
revealing, character-specific moment.
    What to do?
    Ask yourself this question: If my character, in a state of shock, were to
call upon God, how would she and she alone do it? If she were from
Alabama, would she say, “Sweet, bleeding Jesus”? If she were from Detroit,
would she look up to the sky and plead, “Lord have mercy”? If she were
from New York, would she call upon the devil instead and curse, “Well,
damn me to hell”? Whatever your choice, find words so true to your
character, they wouldn’t quite fit in anyone else’s mouth.
    We’ll examine character-specific language in depth in Part Three.


OSTENTATIOUS LANGUAGE

In a dialogue scene near the end of James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as
a Young Man, the novel’s protagonist, Stephen Dedalus, and Lynch, his
friend, debate aesthetics. To clinch his argument, Stephen describes the
ideal relationship between an author and his finished work in these words:
“The artist, like the God of creation, remains within or behind or beyond or
above his handiwork, invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring
his fingernails.”
    Joyce’s analogy advocates a writing method that so harmonizes
characters and events, the telling seems authorless. Applied to dialogue, the
Joycean ideal becomes talk so true to the vocal personalities that any hint of
string pulling vanishes. Rather, each spoken word draws us deeper and
deeper into the storytelling, holding us spellbound to the end.
    Ostentatiousness breaks that spell. By ostentatious dialogue, I mean self-
conscious displays of literariness, lines so unnecessarily expressive, so
clearly out of character that they call attention to the writing as writing. The
worst of these jumps out of the scene waving pompoms in celebration of its
author’s victory, declaring, “Oh, what a clever line am I!”
    Like stand-up comics who laugh at their own jokes, like exhibitionistic
athletes who dance in the end zone, literary swagger celebrates its success.
But the instant a line of dialogue makes the reader or audience aware of art
as art, the bond of belief fused between them and the character snaps.
    As we noted in the “as if” discussion in Chapter Five, when people open
a book or sit down as an audience, they shift their mental gears from the
factual to the fictional mode. They know that to take part in the ritual of
story, they must willingly believe in imaginary characters as if they were
real, and react to fictitious events as if they were actually happening. It’s a
childlike state, so a bond of trust must run through the story, that ancient
contract that conjoins a reader/audience to an author.
    That’s the deal, and no matter how realistic or fantasied the genre, the
bond will hold so long as the reader/audience finds the dialogue true to the
characters who speak it. The moment technique becomes visible, dialogue
rings false, the reader/audience loses trust, the bond breaks, and the scene
fails. Break belief often enough, the reader/audience tears up the contract
and tosses your work in the trash.
    Of all aspects of characterization—dress, gesture, age, sexuality, mood,
facial expression—speech is by far the most susceptible to disbelief. Odd
phrasings, eccentric word choices, even out-of-place pauses can betray the
odor of bad acting—fake emotions, shallow mind, and hollow heart. That’s
why every line of dialogue puts the writer under pressure to maintain the
bond of credibility.
    As an author, you must develop taste enough to sense the shift from
expressivity to exhibitionism. To do so, first test the limits of language your
medium imposes. What could be said with moving conviction on page may
be embarrassingly unactable onstage. Because the marker dividing veracity
from falsity is set as much by tradition as by authorship, first identify your
story’s genre(s), and then study the conventions. Finally, bring your best
judgment to bear by asking this question: If I were my character, in these
circumstances, what would I say? The only curbs on garishness are your
innate taste and schooled judgment. So let your inner acumen be your
guide. When in doubt, tone it down.


ARID LANGUAGE

The opposite of ostentation is desert-dry, Latinate, polysyllabic language
composed into long sentences strung out over long speeches. The
suggestions below help avoid arid speech in favor of natural, unaffected,
seemingly spontaneous dialogue. But always bear in mind that these points
(like all else in this book) are guidelines, not imperatives. Every writer has
to find her own way.


PREFER THE CONCRETE TO THE ABSTRACT

Would a twenty-first-century character call her home a “domicile” or her
car a “vehicle”? Doubtful. On the other hand, there may be people who
would. So if you have a character-specific reason for your role’s formality,
then by all means, give her an abstract vocabulary. Otherwise, keep it real
with specific names for objects and actions.


PREFER THE FAMILIAR TO THE EXOTIC

Would your character refer to his house as his palais or his apartment as his
pied-à-terre? Doubtful. Then again, he may be la-di-da by nature… or
actually French.


PREFER SHORT WORDS TO LONG WORDS

Would you write a line such as “His fabrications are falsifications of
factuality”? Doubtful. “He stretches the truth,” or simply, “He lies,” or
bluntly, “He bullshits,” would be more credible choices.
    And you always have at least two choices. English grew out of the
merger of two languages, Anglo-Saxon, a dialect of Old German, and Old
French, a dialect of Latin. As a result, the vocabulary of the language that
became modern English immediately doubled (see the sidebar). English has
at least two words for everything. In fact, with more than a million words,
the English vocabulary offers near-inexhaustible choices.
       HOW ENGLISH BECAME A DOUBLE LANGUAGE
  After the Romans conquered England in the first century AD, they hired German and
  Scandinavian mercenaries from Anglia and Saxony to help fend off pirates and put
  down rebellions by the native Picts and Celts. When the Roman Empire abandoned
  England in 410 AD, more Anglo-Saxons migrated to the island, marginalizing the
  Gallic-speaking Celts, wiping out the Latin of the Romans, and imposing their
  Germanic tongue throughout England.
       But 600 years later Latin came back this roundabout way: In 911 AD Danish
  Vikings conquered territory along the north coast of France and named it after
  themselves, Normandy, land of the Norsemen. After 150 years of marriage to French
  women, these Danes spoke what their mothers spoke, a thousand-year-old French
  dialect of Latin. In 1066 King Wilhelm of Normandy (a.k.a. William the Conqueror) led
  his armies across the English Channel and defeated the English king. With that
  victory, French came to England.
       Throughout history, foreign conquests usually erase native languages. But
  England was the exception. For some mysterious reason, the Germanic language of
  the Anglo-Saxons and the Latinate French of the Normans merged. As a result, the
  vocabulary of what became modern English doubled. English has at least two words
  for everything. Compare, for example, the Germanic-rooted words “fire,” “hand,” “tip,”
  “ham,” and “flow” to the French-derived words “flame,” “palm,” “point,” “pork,” and
  “fluid.”




   Given the massive vocabulary of English, I offer this guiding principle:
Shun polysyllabic words, especially those that end in Latinate suffixes such
as “-ation,” “-uality,” and “-icity.” Instead, favor the punchy, vivid one-or
two-syllable words that, more often than not, come from the ancient Anglo-
Saxon heritage of English. But whether your phrasings follow from the
Germanic or French traditions, consider these four observations in making
word choices:
   1) The more emotional people become, the shorter the words and
sentences they use; the more rational people become, the longer the words
and sentences they use.
     2) The more active and direct people become, the shorter the words and
sentences they use; the more passive and reflective people become, the
longer the words and sentences they use.
     3) The more intelligent the person, the more complex his sentences; the
less intelligent, the briefer his sentences.
     4) The more well read the person, the larger his vocabulary and the
longer his words; the less read, the smaller his vocabulary and the shorter
his words.
     Returning to an earlier example, consider the line “His fabrications are
falsifications of factuality” as opposed to “The son of a bitch lies.” The
former polysyllabic, alliterated, Latinized accusation might be said by a
bemused wigged barrister in a litigation comedy that satirizes the
formalities of royal high court. The six monosyllables of the latter, however,
could be said in anger by almost anyone anywhere.
     When conflict builds and risk soars, people get emotional, active, direct,
monosyllabic, and dumb. As conflict peaks, people often say really stupid
things they later regret. In all media and all structural shapes of story,
conflict-rich scenes not only carry the telling, but as strife progresses, they
also tend to shape talk in the four ways I’ve described above.
     On the other hand, when composing a story in the past tense of prose,
reflective passages with little or no conflict become fairly common. So once
again, let me remind you that the guidelines in this book only describe
tendencies. Somewhere, somehow, someone’s behavior turns every
psychological doctrine ever formulated on its head. The same is true of
writing. Every principle of craft sets up its creative contradiction.
     Consider, for example, Boyd Crowder, the protagonist’s frenemy in the
long-form series JUSTIFIED. Showrunner Graham Yost pitched the
dialogue for the entire cast at a heightened timbre. But for Boyd, he reached
centuries back into the show’s Appalachian setting and found a speech style
fit for a Confederate politician. Here’s Boyd on going to bed:

                                              BOYD
        Be that as it may, I sense within me a growing, nagging torpor that seeks a
        temporary hibernation in a solitary area for comfort and slumber.
   Over the centuries before the final merger of Latinate French and Old
German into modern English, Latin and French were the languages of
power in England.2 Like many people in public life, politicians and
corporate leaders alike, Boyd Crowder’s quest for power and prestige
propels his life down a series-long spine of action. And like the power
greedy, Boyd flaunts his polysyllabic vocabulary and puts as many words as
possible between the capital letter that opens a sentence and the period that
closes it, scoffing at the admonition below.


PREFER DIRECT PHRASES TO CIRCUMLOCUTION

Would you write: “When I punched the guy, I suddenly realized that it hurt
me a lot more than it hurt him, because after I took my hand out of my
pocket and closed it as tight as I could, making sure that my thumb was on
the outside and not the inside of my fingers, and then hit him in the face as
hard as I could, I felt a sharp pain and couldn’t close my fist anymore”? Or:
“Broke my fist on his jaw. Hurt like hell.”
    Wording reflects the distinct qualities of a character played out against
his once-in-a-lifetime conflicts. So if, for example, your character is a
scientist, theologian, diplomat, professor, an intellectual of any persuasion,
or simply pretentious, then he or she may very well use elaborate, academic
locutions when calm and rational circumstances allow. But as a general
principle, pace scenes with direct, unaffected speeches of crisp words.
    This principle holds true on page and stage, but particularly onscreen.
The theatre audience listens intensely. The reader can reread a novel’s
sentence if she doesn’t get it on the first pass. Television viewers can record
and rewind, if necessary, to listen to dialogue a second time. Big-screen
dialogue, however, is spoken, then gone. The cinema audience concentrates
through its eyes, not its ears. If moviegoers don’t instantly understand, they
turn to each other asking, “What did he say?”
    But no matter the medium, misunderstood dialogue annoys. What
difference does it make how eloquent your language is if the
reader/audience misses its meaning? Therefore, expressive inversions aside,
let line structure flow from noun to verb to complement in that order.
Clarity above all.


PREFER AN ACTIVE TO A PASSIVE VOICE

Passive dialogue uses linking verbs such as “am,” “is,” “are,” “was,”
“were,” “be,” and “been” to express static states (for example, “He isn’t
very smart”); active dialogue uses action verbs to express dynamic change
(for example, “He’ll figure it out for himself”).
    When humans enter into conflicts, their minds become energized, their
views of themselves and the world around them become active, and
therefore, their language becomes charged with action verbs. When
situations calm, human beings become more passive, their view of life more
reflective, and their language tends to fill with state-of-being verbs. Again,
this pattern is only a tendency, not a rule of human behavior. Nonetheless,
in a storm of conflict, state-of-being verbs slow headway like a ship
dragging anchor.
    The passivity that’s most difficult to spot hides inside gerund phrases. In
these cases, a state-of-being verb connects to an “-ing” ending verb in
phrases such as “She is playing around,” “They are working hard,” “They
were coming home yesterday.” Gerunds give dialogue only slightly more
energy. Before you commit to a gerund phrase, test the active case: “She
plays around,” “They work hard,” “They came home yesterday,” and see
whether a single, direct verb doesn’t better fit the moment.


PREFER SHORT SPEECHES TO LONG

When the pretentious wish to impress, they add syllables to words, words to
sentences, sentences to paragraphs, paragraphs to speeches. They substitute
quantity for quality, length for brevity, convolution for simplicity. The effect
is often unintentionally comic.
    For example, these three bites from the festooned language of Helen
Sinclair (Dianne Wiest), the aging Broadway grande dame, in Woody Allen
and Douglas McGrath’s screenplay BULLETS OVER BROADWAY.
    When she arrives late for a rehearsal:
                                              HELEN
        My pedicurist had a stroke. She fell forward on the orange stick and plunged it into
        my toe. It required bandaging.

   Staring into a dark theatre auditorium:

                                              HELEN
        This old theatre—this church—so replete with memories, so full of ghosts, Mrs.
        Alving, Uncle Vanya, here’s Ophelia, there’s Cordelia… Clytemnestra… every
        performance a birth, each curtain, a death…

   Walking through Central Park with her young playwright:

                                              HELEN
        Everything is meaningful in some unexplainable form, more primordial than mere
        language.
                      (as he tries to talk, she clamps her hand over his mouth)
        Shh… shh… be silent… be silent… Let’s just walk holding our thoughts… not
        revealing them… be still… let the birds have their song but let ours, for now,
        remain unsung.

   So unless, like Woody Allen, your intention is satirical, strive to express
the maximum in the fewest, truest possible words.


PREFER EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE TO MIMICRY

Dialogue should sound like character talk, but its content must be way
above normal. Fine writers listen to the world but rarely copy what they
hear, word for word, to the page. If you study documentaries and listen to
what real people actually say in real life, or watch so-called reality shows
and listen to the improvisations of untrained actors, you’ll soon realize that
everyday talk on camera sounds awkward and amateurish. Fiction takes talk
to a much higher level—far more economic, expressive, layered, and
character-specific than back-fence chatter. Like marble carved by a
Michelangelo, language is raw material chiseled by an author. Don’t copy
life, express it.
ELIMINATE CLUTTER

By clutter, I mean exchanges such as “Hi, how ya doing?” “Oh, I’m fine.”
“And the kids?” “They’re fine, too.” “Isn’t it a beautiful day?” “Yes, finally.
Last week was so rainy.” In the same way people decorate empty shelves
with knickknacks, inept writers dress up vapid scenes with verbal bric-a-
brac, thinking that small talk adds an air of realism. But chitchat makes
characters no more authentic than dressing them in sweat pants makes them
athletic. Worse yet, cluttered talk not only hollows out characters and
scenes; it misleads the reader/audience.
   Dialogue is more than talk in the same way dance is more than
movement, music more than sound, and painting more than shapes. A work
of art means more than the sum of its parts, and every part of the work
means more than the part itself.
   Badly written dialogue tends to be literal; it means what it says and no
more. Well-written dialogue, on the other hand, implies more than it says; it
puts a subtext under every text. Readers and audiences schooled in the
conventions of realism assume that every line has significance beyond its
words or it wouldn’t have been written. For that reason, story-goers seek the
hidden beneath the clutter, the connotation under every denotation. If they
cannot find it, confused and annoyed, they lose interest.
   If your dialogue does not suggest unsaid thoughts and feelings below its
surface, either enrich it or cut it.

                   CONTENT FLAWS


WRITING ON-THE-NOSE

Writing on-the-nose means putting a character’s fullest thoughts and
deepest emotions directly and fully into what she says out loud. Of the
many varieties of inept dialogue, writing on-the-nose is by far the most
common and most ruinous. It flattens characters into cardboard and
trivializes scenes into melodrama and sentimentality. To understand the
damaging effect of on-the-nose writing, let’s study this flaw in depth.
    The axiom “Nothing is what it seems” bears witness to life’s duality:
What seems is the surface of life—what strikes the eye and ear, the things
people say and do… outwardly. What is is the actual life of thought and
feeling that flows inwardly beneath the things said and done.
    As we noted in Chapter Three, a person’s life moves simultaneously
through three levels corresponding to the said, the unsaid, and the
unsayable: outwardly what people say and do, personally and socially, to
get through their day (text); inwardly what they privately think and feel
while they carry out these tasks (conscious subtext); and deepest yet, the
massive realm of subconscious urges and primal miens that drive their inner
energies (subconscious subtext).
    It is, therefore, categorically impossible for a human being to say and do
what she is fully thinking and feeling for the obvious reason: The vast
majority of her thoughts and feelings run below her awareness. These
thoughts cannot, by their nature, rise to the surface of the said. No matter
how hard we may try to be absolutely open and honest, how we try to put
the subtext of truth into the text of our behavior, our subconscious self
haunts every word and deed. As in life, so in story: Every text condenses a
subtext.
    Suppose, for example, you were in mid-session with your psychiatrist,
pouring out your darkest confession of the worst thing you’ve ever done to
another human being. Tears filling your eyes, pain doubling you in two on
the chaise, you choke out the words. And what’s your psychiatrist doing?
Taking notes. And what’s in those notes? What you are not saying. What
you cannot say.
    A psychiatrist is not a stenographer, there to take down your exposés. He
is trained to see through the text of you to the unsayable subtext, to those
things you cannot say because you cannot consciously think them.
    On-the-nose writing eliminates subtext by erasing conscious, unsaid
thoughts and desires, along with subconscious, unsayable longings and
energies, and leaving only spoken words, delivered in blatant, explicit,
hollow-sounding speeches. Or, to put it another way, on-the-nose dialogue
rewrites the subtext into a text, so that characters proclaim exactly and fully
what they think and feel, and therefore, speak in ways no human being has
ever spoken.
    For example, this scene: Two attractive people sit across from each other
in a secluded corner of a graceful restaurant. The light glints off the crystal
and the dewy eyes of the lovers. Beautiful music plays in the background;
gentle breezes billow the curtains. The lovers reach across the table, touch
fingertips, look longingly in each other’s eyes, simultaneously say, “I love
you, I love you,” and actually mean it.
    This scene, if produced, would die like a squashed dog in the road. It is
simply unactable.
    By unactable I mean this: Actors are not marionettes hired to mouth
your words and mime your actions. These artists give life to your cast by
first discovering their character’s true desire hidden in the subtext. They
then ignite this inner energy and with it build ineffable layers of complexity
from the inside out that finally surface in the character’s actions, expressed
in gestures, facial expressions, and words. But the scene, as I described it, is
void of subtext and therefore, by definition, unactable.
    The page, stage, and screen are not opaque surfaces. Each storytelling
medium creates a transparency that allows us to glimpse the unsaid or
unsayable in other human beings. When we watch a television series, a
film, or play, or turn pages of prose, our eye does not stop at the words on
the page or the actor onstage or onscreen. Our eye travels through the text
to the subtext, to the deepest stirrings within the character. When you
experience a quality story, don’t you have the constant impression that you
are reading minds, reading emotions? Don’t you often think to yourself, “I
know what that character’s really thinking, feeling, and doing. I can see
what’s going on inside him better than he can, because he’s blinded by his
immediate problem”? The combined creativity of writer and actor gives us
what we want from any story: to be a fly on the wall of life and see through
the surface to the truth.
    If I were an actor forced to act this candlelit cliché, my first ambition
would be to protect my career. I would not let a bad writer make me look
like a bad actor. I would put a subtext under that scene, even if it had
nothing to do with the story.
    My approach might go like this: Why has this couple gone out of their
way to create a movie scene for themselves? What’s with all the candlelight
and soft music? Why don’t they take their pasta to the TV set like normal
people? What’s wrong with this relationship?
    Isn’t that the truth? When do the candles come out in life? When things
are fine? No. When things are fine, we take our pasta to the TV set like
normal people. When there’s a problem, that’s when the candles come out.
    So, taking that insight to heart, I could act the scene in such a way that
the audience would see to the truth: “Yes, he says he loves her. But look,
he’s desperate he’s losing her.” That subtextual action adds substance as the
scene deepens into a man’s desperate attempt to rekindle the romance. Or
the audience might think, “Yes, he says he loves her, but look, he’s setting
her up to dump her.” That implied action stirs our fascination as we watch a
man let a woman down gently with a last romantic dinner because, in truth,
he’s walking out.
    With rare exceptions, a scene should never be outwardly and entirely
about what it seems to be about. Dialogue should imply, not explain, its
subtext. In the two variations above, the subtextual motivations and tactics
are conscious but unspoken. As the audience/reader perceives the unsaid
tactic beneath the surface of behavior, the inner action gives the scene a
depth that enriches the reader/audience with insight. An ever-present
subtext is the guiding principle of realism.
    Nonrealism, on the other hand, is the great exception. Nonrealism
employs on-the-nose dialogue in all its genres and subgenres: myth and
fairy tale, science fiction and time travel, animation, the musical, the
supernatural, Theatre of the Absurd, action/adventure, farce, horror,
allegory, magical realism, postmodernism, dieselpunk retrofuturism, and the
like.
    In nonrealism, characters become more archetypical and less
dimensional. Stories set in imaginary or exaggerated worlds move toward
allegorical event designs. Pixar’s INSIDE OUT, for example. As a result,
subtext tends to atrophy as dialogue becomes less complex, more
explanatory, more on-the-nose. In a work such as THE LORD OF THE
RINGS, no hidden or double meaning plays under lines such as “Those who
venture there never return.” If an actor were to layer that line with irony, it
might prompt a laugh and kill the moment.
    At some point during the fiction-writing process, every writer must
answer that troublesome question: Exactly what kind of story am I telling?
Two grand visions define the storyteller’s approach to reality: the mimetic
and the symbolic.
    Mimetic stories reflect or imitate life as lived and sort themselves into
the various genres of realism. Symbolic stories exaggerate or abstract life as
lived and fall into one of the many genres of nonrealism. Neither approach
has a greater claim on faithfulness to the truth. All stories are metaphors for
existence, and the degree of realism versus nonrealism is simply a writer’s
choice in his strategy to persuade and involve the reader/audience while he
expresses his vision.
    Nonetheless, one of the key differences between nonrealism and realism
is subtext. Nonrealism tends to diminish or eliminate it; realism can’t exist
without it.
    Why?
    Because to clarify and purify a character’s symbolic nature—virtue,
villainy, love, greed, innocence, and such—nonrealistic genres eliminate the
subconscious and with that, psychological complexity.
    Whereas, the first premise of realism is that the majority of what a
person thinks and feels is unconscious to her, and for that reason, the full
content of her thoughts and feelings can never be expressed directly,
literally, or completely. Therefore, to dimensionalize, complicate, and
ironize the psychology of the role, mimetic genres clash desires arising
from the subconscious against conscious willpower.
    The psychological and social complexity of realism demands a subtext
under virtually every line of dialogue. To avoid these distracting intricacies,
nonrealism discourages subtext.


THE MONOLOGUE FALLACY

Every consequential moment in life pivots around a dynamic of
action/reaction. In the physical realm, reactions are equal, opposite, and
predictable in obedience to Newton’s third law of motion; in the human
sphere, the unforeseen rules. Whenever we take an important step, our
world reacts—but almost never in the way we expect. From within us or
around us come reactions we cannot and do not see coming. For no matter
how much we rehearse life’s big moments, when they finally arrive, they
never seem to work out quite the way we thought, hoped, or planned. The
drama of life is an endless improvisation.
    For this reason, when a character sits alone staring at a wall, his flow of
thought is an inner dialogue, not a monologue. This inner flux often
becomes the stuff and substance of the modern novel. Prose writers can take
us inside their characters’ heads, bouncing inner actions back and forth
between a thinking self and his doubting, applauding, criticizing, arguing,
forgiving, listening, ever-reacting selves. This purpose-filled give-and-take
is dialogue that takes the form of thought rather than talk.
    A true monologue would provoke no response as it pours out long,
uninterrupted, inactive, unreactive passages to no one in particular, turning
characters into mouthpieces for their author’s philosophy. Whether voiced
aloud or thought from within, any speech that runs on for too long without
change in value charge risks lifelessness, artificiality, and tedium.
    How long is too long? The average speaking rate ranges between two to
three words per second. At that pace, a two-minute speech could contain
three hundred words. Onstage or onscreen, that’s a lot of talk without
someone or something reacting. In a novel, three hundred words is a full
page. Pages of first-person musing or memory, unbroken by the crisscross
of counterpointing inner reactions, would severely test the reader’s
patience.
    On the other hand, suppose you were writing a two-character scene and
feel that Character A talks throughout, while Character B sits in silence. In
that case, long speeches become natural and necessary. As you write them,
however, remember that even if Character A has rehearsed her
confrontation with Character B, as she begins to tell him what’s on her
mind, the scene will not play out the way she expected.
    Let’s say, for example, that Character A expected Character B to defend
himself against her accusations and so she memorized a long list of stinging
retorts. But instead of arguing, he sits there in dead silence. His stone-faced
reaction destroys her prepared speech. This unexpected turn forces her to
improvise, and as we noted earlier, life is always an improvisation, always
action/reaction.
    On the page, therefore, insert Character A’s nonverbal reactions to
Character B’s enigma. Into her column of talk, interlace her looks, gestures,
pauses, stumbling phrases, and the like. Break her scene-long speech into
beats of action/reaction within her and between her and the silent Character
B.
    Imagine another example: Let’s say your character is reading a well-
prepared sermon to her church’s congregation. As her eyes move down the
page, might she glance up, now and then, to check the congregation for
expressions of interest or lack thereof? Suppose some people look bored,
what would she do? Might not thoughts bounce through her mind,
inspecting her voice, her gestures, the nervous energy in her belly, telling
her to breathe, to relax, to smile, to make one adjustment after another as
she performs her sermon? Her sermon may seem like a monologue, but her
inner life is a dynamic dialogue.
    Let’s take the action/reaction principle a step further: Suppose that your
character talks at length by nature. Consider Meryl Streep’s Violet Weston
in the film AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY. Long speeches drive her
behavior as she dominates all conversation and never reacts to what people
think or feel. Such a character may bore other characters, but you can’t
allow her to bore the audience. Therefore, like playwright Tracy Letts,
create the impression of long-windedness without actually going on and on.
Watch the film and notice how Letts propels Violet’s speeches, then builds
each scene around the reactions of her word-weary relatives who have no
choice but to suffer the talkaholic.
    In 1889, playwright August Strindberg wrote The Stronger. The play is
set in a café and dramatizes an hour-long scene that pits Mrs. X, a wife,
against her husband’s mistress, Miss Y. Mrs. X carries all the dialogue, but
when performed, the silent Miss Y becomes the star role.


THE DUELOGUE

Think of the thousands of hours of bad film, television, and theatre you
have suffered through. I suspect that more often than not, the shallow, tinny
acting was not the fault of the actors but of the unactable duelogues that
writers and their directors forced them to recite. Duelogue is my term for
face-to-face confrontations in which two characters talk directly, explicitly,
and emotionally about their immediate problem. Duelogues have the
resonance of a brick because every line is on-the-nose, nothing left unsaid.
    For example, this scene from the film GLADIATOR. The Emperor
Commodus has imprisoned his rival Maximus Decimus Meridius. That
night Maximus discovers Lucilla, Commodus’s sister, waiting in his cell.
     INT. DUNGEON—NIGHT

     Guards take Maximus to an empty cell and chain him to the wall. As they leave, Lucilla
     steps out of the shadows.

                                             LUCILLA
         Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions.

                                            MAXIMUS
         I knew your brother would send assassins. I didn’t think he would send his best.

                                             LUCILLA
Maximus… he doesn’t know.

                                     MAXIMUS
My family was burned and crucified while they were still alive.

                                     LUCILLA
I knew nothing—

                                     MAXIMUS
                                      (shouting)
—Don’t lie to me.

                                     LUCILLA
I wept for them.

                                     MAXIMUS
As you wept for your father?

                             (grabbing her by the throat)
As you wept for your father?
                                     LUCILLA
I have been living in a prison of fear since that day. To be unable to mourn your
father for fear of your brother. To live in terror every moment of every day because
your son is heir to the throne. Oh, I’ve wept.

                                     MAXIMUS
My son… was innocent.

                                     LUCILLA
So… is… mine.

                                       (pause)
Must my son die too before you will trust me?

                                     MAXIMUS
What does it matter whether I trust you or not?

                                     LUCILLA
The gods have spared you. Don’t you understand? Today I saw a slave become
more powerful than the emperor of Rome.

                                     MAXIMUS
The gods spared me? I am at their mercy, with the power only to amuse the mob.

                                      LUCILLA
That is power. The mob is Rome, and while Commodus controls them, he controls
everything.
                                        (pause)
Listen to me, my brother has enemies, most of all in the senate. But while the
people follow him, no one would dare stand up to him until you.

                                     MAXIMUS
They oppose him yet they do nothing.

                                      LUCILLA
There are some politicians who have dedicated their lives to Rome. One man above
all. If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

                                     MAXIMUS
Do you not understand, I may die in this cell tonight, or in the arena tomorrow. I am
a slave. What possible difference can I make?

                                      LUCILLA
This man wants what you want.

                                     MAXIMUS
                                      (shouting)
Then have him kill Commodus.

                                      LUCILLA
I knew a man once, a noble man, a man of principle who loved my father and my
father loved him. This man served Rome well.

                                     MAXIMUS
That man is gone. Your brother did his work well.
                                            LUCILLA
         Let me help you.

                                            MAXIMUS
         Yes, you can help me. Forget you ever knew me and never come here again.
                                            (calling out)
         Guard. The lady is finished with me.

     Lucilla, in tears, leaves.

    In Chapter Four of The Poetics, Aristotle argues that the deepest
pleasure of theatregoing is learning, the sensation of seeing through the
surface of behavior to the human truth beneath. Therefore, if you use
dialogue to turn your characters’ unspoken needs and emotions into
conscious pronouncements as in the scene above, if, in other words, you
write the scene about what the scene is actually about, you block that
insight and deprive the reader/audience of their rightful pleasure. Worse yet,
you falsify life.
    In the give-and-take of life, we circle around problems, instinctively
employing pretexts and tactics that skirt the painful, unspeakable truths that
lurk in our subconscious. We rarely talk face-to-face, openly and directly,
about our truest needs or desires. Instead, we try to get what we want from
another person by navigating our way through a third thing.
    Therefore, you will find the fix for on-the-nose writing in something
outside the immediate conflict, a third thing that diverts a duelogue into a
trialogue.


THE TRIALOGUE

Trialogue, as I redefine the term, names the triangular relationship between
two characters in conflict and the third thing through which they funnel
their struggle.
   Four examples:
   In his novel Legs, William Kennedy tells the story of the gangster, Jack
“Legs” Diamond. In Chapter Three, as Jack comes into his house, his wife
Alice confronts him. Jack’s men, Oxie and Fogarty, have told her that Jack
nicknamed one of their canaries Marion because the bird reminds him of his
mistress. In the scene that follows, two canaries act as the third thing. The
narrator is Jack’s lawyer:

      We were hardly inside the house when Alice called out to Jack,
   “Will you come here please?” She was on the front porch, with Oxie
   and Fogarty still on the sofa. They were not moving, not speaking,
   not looking at Alice or at Jack or at me either when we got there.
   They both stared out toward the road.
      Alice opened the canary cage and said to Jack, “Which one do
   you call Marion?”
      Jack quickly turned to Fogarty and Oxie.
      “Don’t look at them, they didn’t tell me,” Alice said. “I just heard
   them talking. Is it the one with the black spot on its head?”
      Jack didn’t answer, didn’t move. Alice grabbed the bird with the
   black spot and held it in her fist.
      “You don’t have to tell me—the black spot’s for her black hair.
   Isn’t it? Isn’t it?”
      When Jack said nothing, Alice wrung the bird’s neck and threw it
   back in the cage. “That’s how much I love you,” she said and started
   past Jack, toward the living room, but he grabbed her and pulled her
   back. He reached for the second bird and squeezed it to death with
   one hand, then shoved the twitching, eye-bleeding corpse down the
   crevice of Alice’s breasts. “I love you too,” he said.
      That solved everything for the canaries.

    When Vince Gilligan pitched his long-form series BREAKING BAD to
the network, his logline was “Mr. Chips goes Scarface.” The protagonist,
Walter White, faces multiple conflicts on all levels of life in dozens of
directions, surrounded by a large cast of antagonists. Although building a
drug empire seems to be Walter’s super-intention, Gilligan casts the shadow
of Heisenberg, Walter’s doppelgänger, over all his scenes. From the very
first episode, Walter’s desires and dreads, his actions and reactions, are
simply manifestations of Heisenberg’s struggle to take over Walter and
achieve the ultimate triumph of his genius. Heisenberg is BREAKING
BAD’s third thing.
   Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children is an allegorical novel whose
protagonist, Saleem Sinai, is telepathic. But the third thing that modulates
the novel’s conflicts is not paranormal. Rather, Rushdie runs Sinai’s every
conflict through the cultural gap between India and Europe. By
foregrounding what would normally be a background desire and painting
every scene with a shade of East versus West, Rushdie colors his novel with
an all-constant third thing.
   For many readers and theatregoers, Samuel Beckett was the greatest
writer of the twentieth century and his masterpiece is Waiting for Godot.
The play shuttles a massive trialogue between Estragon and Vladimir (two
homeless tramps) and Godot (the eponymous character named after the
French slang for God). As the title implies, the two men spend the entire
play waiting, hoping, arguing about, and preparing for “he who will never
appear.” The waiting seems futile, but it gives the tramps a reason, as they
put it, “for going on.”
   In other words, Godot, Beckett’s third thing, symbolizes the persistent
belief that life will ultimately make beautiful and meaningful sense, once
we find that transcendent, mysterious something that awaits us
somewhere… somehow… out there…

                     DESIGN FLAWS


REPETITION

What makes otherwise vigorous language lie lifeless on the page? What
makes scenes turn antiprogressive and their dialogue fall flat? I can think of
many reasons, but the most common fault is the writer’s dread enemy—
repetitiousness.
   Two kinds of repetition may infect a scene’s dialogue.
   1) Accidental echoes. When your eye skims down a page, lines like
“They’re moving their car over there” may speed by unnoticed. To avoid
these verbal mishaps, record your dialogue after every draft, and then play
it back. When you act your dialogue aloud or hear it acted to you,
accidental echoes pop out, and you’ll instantly know what to cut or rewrite.
   2) Repetitious beats. Beyond echoing words, the greater danger is
repetition of feeling: the same charge of value, positive-positive-positive-
positive-positive, or negative-negative-negative-negative-negative, running
on, beat after beat.
   Repetitious feelings can be insidiously hard to spot because they hide
behind variations in wording. So although the scene reads well, it feels, for
some mysterious reason, dead.
   Whenever a character takes an action in the pursuit of his or her scene
intention, someone or something somewhere in the scene reacts. This
pattern of action/reaction in character behavior is called a beat. For
example, Character A pleads with Character B to listen to him, but
Character B rejects what he has to say. Using gerunds to express action, that
beat becomes begging/rejecting. (See Chapter Twelve for the complete
definition of a beat.)
    Beats propel scenes by advancing the action/reaction dynamic of
character behaviors, each beat topping the previous beat, until the value at
stake in the scene changes its charge at the turning point. (See the scene
breakdowns in Chapters Thirteen through Eighteen.) But when the same
beat repeats itself, the scene flattens out and boredom sets in. Repetitious
behavior is far more common than accidental alliterations, more damaging
to a scene, and insidiously difficult to spot. Consider this passage:

                                          CHARACTER A
        I have to talk to you.


                                          CHARACTER B
        No, leave me alone.


                                          CHARACTER A
        It’s really important you listen to me.


                                          CHARACTER B
        Just let me be.


                                          CHARACTER A
        You’ve got to hear what I’ve got to say.


                                          CHARACTER B
        Shut up and go away.


   Character A begs Character B three times to listen to him, and three
times over she rejects his plea in virtually the same language: “talk, listen,
hear; alone, let, go away.” Some writers try to solve this problem by using
synonyms or switching the action/reaction beat around in the belief that
textual rephrasing changes the beat. In this rewrite, for example, rejecting
becomes the action and begging the reaction.

                                           CHARACTER B
        Just standing there you bother me.


                                           CHARACTER A
        I’m not bothering you, I’m trying to talk to you.


                                           CHARACTER B
        I’ve heard enough.


                                           CHARACTER A
        You haven’t heard a single word I’ve said.


                                           CHARACTER B
        Because I’m fed up with your BS.


                                           CHARACTER A
        Believe me, it’s not BS. It’s the truth.


    And on it goes. The identical beat of rejecting/begging, whether in the
same words or different words, never changes, never progresses.
    Some writers defend redundancies by claiming they’re lifelike. And it’s
true. People do repeat themselves. Monotony is lifelike… and lifeless. My
aesthetic calls for life-filled tellings. Stories, after all, are metaphors, not
photocopies. Verisimilitude, the so-called “telling detail,” is a stylistic
strategy to enhance credibility, not a substitute for creative insight.
    The ultimate storytelling sin is boredom—a villainous violation of the
law of diminishing returns. This law states: The more often an experience
repeats, the less effect it has. The first ice cream cone tastes great; the
second one loses flavor; the third makes you sick. In fact, the same cause
repeated back-to-back not only loses its impact, but in time also causes an
opposite effect.
    Repetitiousness follows a three-step pattern: The first time an artist
skillfully uses a technique, it has its intended effect. If he immediately
repeats that technique, it has less than half of the intended effect. If he’s
foolish enough to try it a third time, it will not only lack the effect he wants,
but swing around from behind and inflict the reverse effect.
    Suppose, for example, you were to write three scenes in a row, all tragic,
expecting the audience to cry in all three. What would be the aftereffect of
that composition? In the first scene, the audience members may cry; in the
second scene they might sniffle; and in the third scene they will laugh their
heads off. Not because the third scene isn’t sad; it may be the most tragic of
all. But because you have drained them of their tears, they feel it’s ludicrous
and insensitive of you to think they’ll cry a third time, so they flip tragedy
into comedy. The law of diminishing returns (true in life as it is in art)
applies to all storytelling forms and contents—desires and conflicts, moods
and emotions, images and actions, words and phrases.
    Repetitious beats notoriously plague first drafts. Why? Because in the
early going, the writer is still searching for the succinct, character-specific
language that would nail each action/reaction with a single stroke of
speech/reply. Instead, he repeats the same beat in different words, thinking
he can substitute quantity for quality, deceiving himself with the belief that
repetition reinforces meaning. In fact, it does the opposite. Repetition
trivializes meaning.
    So, what to do?
    Never compromise. Fine writers scour their knowledge and imagination
until they find the perfect choice. They write draft after draft, constantly
improvising, playing one line against another, tossing lines around in their
imagination, mouthing them out, and then, writing them down.
    Gazing out the window daydreaming is not creativity. Aesthetic choices
only come alive on paper. No matter how banal a line may be, write it
down. Write down every choice that passes through your imagination. Do
not wait for the moment your genius decides to wake up and give you a gift.
Make the perfect choice by continuously moving your thoughts out of your
brain and into the real world of the page. That’s writing.
    But even the most experienced writers will hit a wall as they stare at a
beat and realize that for this particular action/reaction in this particular
scene, no perfect choice exists. They do what they must. They stop banging
their head against the keyboard and make a decision.
   They go back and look through all the imperfect choices they wrote
down. They ask, “Which of all of these possible choices is the best? Could
there be a combination of imperfect choices that’s better than any one
choice?”
   The final choice may not be ideal, but it is the one that comes closest to
perfection. They will live with it today and hope that in some future draft,
they will find an even better choice. But for the moment, at least, they’ve
pruned their repetitious bramble.


MISSHAPEN LINES

Ideally, every line of dialogue is so perfectly worded, it fits its character in
the moment and makes the immediate sense its author intended. Misshapen
lines are like trip wires strung across a scene’s path. They force confused
readers and audiences to reread, rewind, or ask the person in the next seat,
“What did he say?” I can think of three primary reasons that the wording of
a line fails to instantly express itself: blurred meaning, mistimed meaning,
and mistimed cues.

Blurred Meaning
Nouns name objects; verbs name actions. The amplitude of nouns and verbs
ranges from the universal to the concrete, from the generic to the specific.
As a general rule, specific nouns and verbs tend to sharpen meaning, while
generic nouns and verbs modified by adjectives and adverbs tend to blur
meaning.
    Imagine writing a scene set in a shipyard. As a deckhand struggles to
repair a sailboat’s mast step, a boatsmith looks over his shoulder and offers
advice. Which of these two lines conveys its meaning with instant clarity:
“Forcefully utilize a big nail” or “Hammer a spike”?
    The second, of course. The first not only seems unnaturally formal, but
it also forces the reader/audience to rethink the meaning because the word
“nail” covers many dozens of sharp-pointed fasteners, the adjective “big”
could be anything over a couple of inches, “utilize” is as vague a verb as
any in the language, and the adverb “forcefully” seems unnecessary. As a
result, the first line needs two or three mental passes to make sense.
    The lesson is this: Lines of dialogue that name specific objects and
actions tend to express immediate understanding in clear, vivid images.
Therefore, unless you intend ambiguous or mysterious qualities, avoid
generic nouns and verbs strung with adjectives and adverbs.

Mistimed Meaning
The instant a speech makes sense, its reader or audience absorbs the line’s
action and leaps ahead to witness the reaction from the other side of the
scene. Lines that mistime their meaning disrupt this action/reaction rhythm.
Break interest frequently enough, and readers will toss your book; TV
viewers will change channels, theatre audiences will leave at intermission.
Therefore, before you send your writing into the world, reread the dialogue
carefully, act out speeches if necessary, study each line, and listen for the
precise moment of meaning.
    Too late: When a speech drones on word after word without getting to
its point, the reader/audience has one of two reactions: Either they lose
patience and skip over the point, or they guess the point long before it
arrives, and then sit in boredom as the speech stumbles to an anticlimax.
    Too soon: When a speech begins with its meaning and then rattles on,
interest quickly wanes. Readers skim over the words that follow; audiences
tune out.
    To skillfully time the meaning of each line, follow the guiding principles
we previously covered: economy and design. 1) Say the maximum in the
fewest words. 2) Master the three basic sentence designs—cumulative,
balanced, suspense—so you can place meaning wherever you think best:
beginning, middle, or end.


Mistimed Cues
A scene finds its natural rhythm of action/reaction in the give-and-take of
meaning. Until a character has some sense of what was just said, of what
just happened, he waits in limbo. But the instant Character A senses (or
thinks he senses) what Character B is saying or doing, he reacts. Although
most reactions seem instinctive, spontaneous, and instantaneous, they are in
fact triggered by a glimpse of meaning. Character A may completely
misinterpret the moment and overreact, underreact, or react off-the-wall.
Nonetheless, his reaction, indeed every reaction, needs an action to prompt
it.
    Therefore, ideally, the last word or phrase of each speech is the core
word that seals meaning and cues a reaction from the other side of the
scene. On page, mistiming the core word is a relatively minor problem, but
in the theatre or on a soundstage, it can break scenic rhythm and ruin
performances.
    A miscue happens when a core word is placed too early in Character A’s
line and prompts a reaction from Character B, but because Character A has
more words to recite, Actor B must swallow her response and wait while
Actor A finishes performing his speech.
    To make cueing technique clear, let’s work with this passage adapted
from Act 1, Scene 5 of John Pielmeier’s play Agnes of God.
    Sister Agnes, a young nun, has given birth inside a convent. The
newborn’s dead body was found in a wastepaper basket next to Agnes’s
blood-soaked bed. Agnes claims to be a virgin. Some weeks prior to
Agnes’s giving birth, a hole appeared in the palm of Agnes’s hand. The
convent’s Mother Superior wants to believe that these events are the work
of God.
    The police suspect that Agnes committed neonaticide, and so the court
has appointed Dr. Martha Livingston, a psychiatrist, to determine Agnes’s
sanity. After examining Agnes, the doctor and Mother Superior talk.
    As you read this passage, notice how the line structure places the core
word or phrase at or near the end of speeches. This technique creates crisp
cueing and a well-paced rhythm of action/reaction:

              MOTHER SUPERIOR: Look, I know what you’re thinking. She’s an
              hysteric, pure and simple.

              DOCTOR LIVINGSTON: Not simple, no.
             MOTHER: I saw the hole. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you
             think hysteria did that?

             DOCTOR: It’s been doing it for centuries—she’s not unique, you
             know. She’s just another victim.

             MOTHER: Yes, God’s victim. That’s her innocence. She belongs to
             God.

             DOCTOR: And I mean to take her away from Him. Isn’t that what you
             fear?

             MOTHER: You bet I do.

             DOCTOR: Well, I prefer to look upon it as opening her mind, so she
             can begin to heal.

             MOTHER: But that’s not your job, is it? You’re here to diagnose, not
             to heal.

             DOCTOR: I’m here to help her in whatever way I see fit. That’s my
             duty as a doctor.

             MOTHER: But not as an employee of the court. You’re here to make a
             decision on her sanity as quickly as possible.

             DOCTOR: Not as possible. As quickly as I see fit.

             MOTHER: The kindest thing you can do for Agnes is to make that
             decision and let her go.

             DOCTOR: And what then? If I say she’s crazy, she goes to an
             institution. If I say she’s sane, she goes to prison.


   Now, I’ll rephrase the lines and move their core words back into the
middle of each speech. Notice how the overall meanings stay more or less
the same, but the cueing stumbles, the actions/reactions seem to spasm, and
the scene staggers along.
              MOTHER: Look, she’s an hysteric, pure and simple. I know what
              you’re thinking.

              DOCTOR: No, not simple.

              MOTHER: Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria
              did that? I saw the hole.

              DOCTOR: It’s been doing it for centuries. She’s just another victim.
              She’s not unique, you know.

              MOTHER: Yes, she belongs to God. God’s victim. That’s her
              innocence.

              DOCTOR: Is that what you fear? That I mean to take her away from
              Him?

              MOTHER: I do, you bet.

              DOCTOR: Well, opening her mind, so she can begin to heal, is how I
              prefer to look upon it.

              MOTHER: You’re not here to heal but to diagnose. That’s your job,
              isn’t it?

              DOCTOR: My duty as a doctor is to help her in whatever way I see fit.

              MOTHER: You’re here to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as
              possible as an employee of the court.

              DOCTOR: As quickly as I see fit. Not as possible.

              MOTHER: Make that decision and let her go. That’s the kindest thing
              you can do for Agnes.

              DOCTOR: And what then? She goes to prison if I say she’s sane. She
              goes to an institution if I say she’s crazy.


   When actors encounter scenes of this kind, one of three things will
happen: Actors will cut off each other’s lines, talk over each other, or phony
up their performance by politely and unnaturally waiting for each speech to
end. None of these options solves the problem of mistimed cues.
    Generally, speeches that end with cumulative sentences cause miscues.
Before your scenes reach performance, act them aloud into a recorder and
listen for the core words. Then go through the lines again, this time with a
highlighter, and mark the core words, paying special attention to the last
sentence of each speech. You will see that some phrases, especially
prepositional phrases, tend to float to the ends of lines (just as they did in
my last sentence). If so, cut or rephrase so that each speech ends on its cue.


MISSHAPEN SCENES

Faulty designs may also infect scenes. Like a misshapen line that mistimes
its core word, a misshapen scene can mistime its turning point, bringing it
in too soon or too late or not at all. A well-shaped scene pivots around its
turning point in just the right way at just the right moment. From story to
story, the “right” moment for any scene’s turning point is unpredictable and
idiosyncratic. Nonetheless, when timing misfires, the reader/audience feels
it.
    Too soon:
    The first beat powerfully jolts the scene around its turning point. But
from that moment on, the scene runs anticlimactically downhill as
characters pour out exposition.
    Example: A scene we’ll call “The Lovers Break Up.”
    Version 1: In the first beat one lover declares the relationship over; the
other agrees. The action/reaction of this immediate turning point swings the
value charge of love from positive to negative. A beat of resolution may
need to follow, but if the scene goes on and on as the lovers pour out their
history, reminiscing about the good times and lamenting the bad, the
reader/audience may turn against the scene and its characters, thinking,
“You guys are done. Get over it.”
    Too late:
    Repetitious beats of dialogue prattle on far too long until, sometime after
the audience has lost interest, the turning point finally arrives.
    Version 2: Lovers whose relationship has run its course reminisce about
the good times and lament the bad until the audience sees the turning point
coming long before it arrives. When the lovers finally agree to break up, the
unsurprised audience sits there, thinking, “I saw this coming ten minutes
ago.”
    Not at all:
    Version 3: A couple floating in the doldrums of their relationship
reminisce about the good times and lament the bad. They never take an
action to either break up or recommit. The value of love is at the same tepid
temperature it was when the scene opened. None of the scene’s beats
executes a turning point. The beats may zigzag in conflict, but the scene
still has no shape, no arc, because the charge of its core value at the end of
the scene is exactly what it was at the beginning of the scene. If nothing
changes, nothing happens. The scene is a repetitious nonevent, leaving the
audience to sit in wonder, asking, “What was the point of all that talk?”
    As you compose beats of dialogue, give thought to the scene’s shape.
Build it beat by beat, line by line, progressively to and around the turning
point, timing that pivotal beat for the perfect moment. You must decide how
sharply or gradually a scene progresses. Your judgment guides what’s too
soon or too late. Every scene has a life of its own, and you have to feel your
way to its ideal shape.


SPLINTERED SCENES

Scenes flow with life when the reader/audience senses a unity between the
characters’ inner motivations and outer tactics. No matter how subtle,
indirect, or disguised their maneuvers may be, somehow what the
characters say and do links back to their underlying desires. Scenes splinter
and die for the converse reason: We sense a breakdown between what
drives the scene from the subtext and what is said and done on the text, a
disconnect between inner intentions and outer behaviors. As a result, the
scene strikes us as false.
   I can think of four reasons that an otherwise promising scene rambles
out of joint, and the dialogue seems phony or lifeless: 1) The inner desires
are fully motivated, but the dialogue is too bland, and so the scene falls flat.
2) The inner wishes are weakly motivated, but the dialogue is overwrought,
and so the scene feels melodramatic. 3) The inner intentions and outer
actions seem irrelevant to one another, and so the scene makes no sense and
dialogue ricochets into non sequitur. 4) The characters’ desires run side by
side, never crossing in conflict. Without conflict, the scene has no turning
point and so nothing changes; without change, dialogue thickens with
exposition, the scene flattens into a nonevent, and we sit bored at best,
confused at worst.
    The writers of nonevents often try to conceal their ineptitude behind
excessive language. Profanity is the common choice. They think that by
inserting expletives into tepid dialogue, they raise the dramatic temperature.
They would be wrong.
    Not, as Seinfeld would remind us, that there’s anything wrong with
profanity per se. Certain settings demand profanity. In long-form crime
series like DEADWOOD, THE WIRE, or THE SOPRANOS, profanity fits
the characters like a silk suit. In fact, when criminals stop swearing, we
know they mean business: A silent gangster is a lethal gangster.
    To reshape a faulty scene, start at either level, subtext or text. You could
work from the outside of it by rewriting the line and then backtracking to
create an inner action to fit. Or you could work from the inside out by going
down into the inner life of your characters and layer by layer rebuild their
deep psychologies and desires from the subtext outward into the scene’s
actions and reactions, sayings and doings. This process demands hard work
and time, but because the inside-out method is more difficult, its successes
are more powerful.


THE PARAPHRASING TRAP

Novice writers want to believe that writing problems are word problems, so
when they sense the need to rewrite, they start by paraphrasing faulty
dialogue, over and over. The more they rephrase, the more on-the-nose their
language becomes, until subtext vanishes and the scene is irredeemably dull
and false.
   When scenes fail, the fault is rarely in the words; the solution will be
found deep within event and character design. Dialogue problems are story
problems.

CREATING DIALOGUE

CHARACTER-SPECIFIC DIALOGUE


THE TWO TALENTS

Creative writing calls on two sources of creativity: story talent and literary
talent. Story talent converts daily existence into meaningful, emotionally
moving events and characters, then sculpts a work’s inner design—what
happens and to whom—to create metaphors for life. Literary talent converts
everyday talk into expressive dialogue, then sculpts verbal designs—what’s
said and to whom—to create metaphors for talk. These two talents combine
to shape scenes.
    Drawing on both talents, fine writers employ an iceberg technique: To
drive their story, they submerge the massive content of unspoken thoughts,
feelings, desires, and actions out of sight in the subtext of scenes; to tell
their story, they create a text of words on the visible tip of character
behavior. Let’s step back to the time those voices first spoke.
    Homer, the earliest storyteller we know by name, recited the more than
250,000 words of description and dialogue in the Iliad and the Odyssey
from memory. With the invention of the alphabet around 800 BC, his epics
were written down and the first dialogue appeared on page. Homer’s
characters argue and accuse each other, they recount the past and predict the
future, but despite the blind poet’s image-rich rhyming couplets, their
speeches tend toward declamations rather than conversations. As a result,
although the choices and actions of his characters express their
individuality, in dialogue they sound remarkably alike.
    In this same period, the first onstage performances were sacred rituals in
which choruses sang, danced, and chanted verse stories of gods and heroes.
Religious ritual slowly evolved into theatre as the chorus leader stepped
forward to become an actor with a distinguishable character. The playwright
Aeschylus introduced a second actor and invented the technique of rapid
face-to-face exchanges of short speeches known as stichomythia, literally
line-talk (from stikho, meaning “line,” and muthos, meaning “talk”). The
rhythmic intensity of characters alternating single lines or phrases,
combined with quick, biting language, unleashed great dramatic power, as
in Aeschylus’s play Agamemnon.
    But it was the introduction of the third actor by Sophocles in plays such
as Oedipus Rex, Antigone, and Electra that gave rise to character
complexity. Sophocles transformed ancient archetypes such as king, queen,
princess, warrior, and messenger into characters with personality,
dimensionality, and singular voices. What these first playwrights sensed—
and what writers of all story media have understood since—is that the more
complex the psychology of a character, the more distinctive his dialogue
must become. In other words, originality in character design finds its final
expression in character-specific dialogue.
    Consider, for example, this exchange between Matthew McConaughey’s
Detective Rustin Spencer “Rust” Cohle and Woody Harrelson’s Detective
Martin Eric “Marty” Hart from the television series TRUE DETECTIVE.
As they watch an old-fashioned tent revival in rural Louisiana, Rust turns to
Marty and says:
                                              RUST
        What do you think is the average IQ of this group, huh?

                                             MARTY
        What do you see up there on your high horse? What do you know about these
        people?

                                              RUST
        Just observations and deduction: I see a propensity for obesity, poverty, a yen for
        fairy tales. Folks putting what few bucks they do have in a little wicker basket
        that’s being passed around. I think it’s safe to say nobody here’s gonna be splitting
        the atom, Marty.

                                              MARTY
        You see that? Your fucking attitude. Not everybody wants to sit alone in an empty
        room beating off to murder manuals. Some folks enjoy community, the common
        good.

                                               RUST
        If the common good’s got to make up fairy tales, then it’s not good for anybody.

    The scene focuses the Rust/Marty conflict through a trialogue. In this
scene the revivalist congregation becomes the third thing, allowing word
choices to distinguish Rust from Marty in two ways: First, their conflicting
attitudes toward the congregation. Rust feels contempt, Marty compassion.
Rust criticizes them; Marty forgives. Second, Rust’s logical
intellectualizations versus Marty’s emotional personalizations. Rust keeps
his cool; Marty loses his. As a result, Rust’s phrasings run noticeably
slower and longer than Marty’s.
    Compare these two lines:
    Rust: “Just observations and deduction: I see a propensity for obesity,
poverty, a yen for fairy tales.”
    Marty: “Not everybody wants to sit alone in an empty room beating off
to murder manuals.”
    Note Rust’s abstract, polysyllabic terms with Latinate suffixes of “-ion”
and “-ity” versus Marty’s concrete images in iambs and trochees: “alone,”
“empty,” “murder.” Showrunner Nic Pizzolatto’s precise word choices
contrast the loner Rust and his need for justice against the gregarious Marty
and his need for intimacy.
    Crafting idiosyncratic speech, however, does not mean tricking up a role
with vocal quirks. A self-conscious stylishness can be like bad acting, the
literary equivalent of hamming it up and hogging the spotlight. Panache
may impress us, but a true voice affects us. The former calls attention to
itself; the latter calls us to life.
    Contemporary writing workshops often stress development of an
inimitable presence in language known as “a voice.” To me, this talk seems
pointless. A writer’s style or so-called voice cannot be found or created
self-consciously. Voice is not a choice; it’s a result.
    A distinctive writing style pays off when a creative personality embraces
a broad and deep knowledge of the human condition. When talent wraps its
arms around content, the tumultuous coupling that follows breeds a singular
manner of expression. Voice is the instinctive, spontaneous consequence of
genius working up a sweat.
    In other words, as you explore your story’s content of role, meaning,
emotion, and action, as you do the hard work that brings life to your
characters, you will write as only you would. That, for better or worse, like
it or not, will be your voice. And like a painter covering canvas after canvas
through decades of toil in search of his vision, your evolution toward a true
voice will take time.
    In writing dialogue, the same principle applies. When an original
character reaches inside for expression, her voice will be the second-nature
consequence of her one-of-a-kind personality, experience, knowledge,
locution, and accent. Ideally, a character’s language is so plausible, so
seemingly natural, so idiosyncratic that every line in every scene seems to
be an improvisation that no one but that specific character in that specific
moment would invent.
    In saying this, I am not advocating difference for the sake of difference.
Quirkiness is not originality, and it takes taste to know the difference. The
ability to tell a true phrase from a clever phrase does not come easy; if it’s
not innate, it must be learned over years of reading and rereading quality
novels, while watching and rewatching exceptional television, films, and
theatre. As you hone your judgment of story and character, one insight
shifts into sharp focus: The foremost facet of dialogue is vocabulary.
    Dramatized storytelling is not about words but characters using words as
they struggle through life. All components of speech from grammar to
phrasing to pace are therefore vital to dialogue. But nothing conveys or
betrays personality as much as a character’s choice of words, the names of
the things that live within him.
VOCABULARY AND CHARACTERIZATION

As noted in previous chapters, nouns name objects and verbs name actions.
A character’s vocabulary names what he knows, what he sees, and what he
feels. His choice of words is all-important because a character’s façade of
talk should be a doorway to his depths. Passive, blurry, generic phrases
flatten a character and numb the audience; active, concrete, sensory
language arouses insights that weave dimension and complexity into a
character.
    To create a brilliant surface of talk that leads the audience into a
character’s depths, your method must move in the reverse direction: Start
within your character, and then work outward from content to form to
effect.
    First, draw on your sensory and visual powers to imagine content (what
your character sees and feels on the inscape, the unsaid and unsayable),
then craft his dialogue (the said) into a form that slips his words into the
reader’s or audience’s ear with effect. In essence, you must transform the
images in your character’s inner life into the verbiage of his outer talk.


THE PRINCIPLE OF CREATIVE LIMITATION

           The tougher the technique, the more brilliant the feat.

Constraint, discipline, and limitation inspire stunning creative achievement;
unrestrained freedom, on the other hand, usually ends in a sprawl. If you
take an easy, undisciplined path that makes little claim on your talent, the
results smudge with paint-by-numbers banality. But if, contrarily, you
choose an arduous technique that demands a master’s proficiency, then
talent builds muscle until your imagination, strained to the tearing point,
explodes with power.
    The great difficulties imposed by creative limitations are why a
Beethoven symphony transcends whistling. Why Whistler’s Mother
surpasses a doodle. Why a high school prom is not the Bolshoi.
    The strategy of surrounding yourself with aesthetic obstacles to compel
creative excellence begins by pitting language against image. Language is
the medium of conscious thought; image is the medium of subconscious
thought. Therefore, writing the first banal phrases that pop to mind is far
easier than expressing character in lucid, three-dimensional imagery found
in the far reaches of your imagination. When you write off the top of your
head, all characters sound alike and the sounds they make irritate like
fingernails on a blackboard. Their grating voices fake life and then fill the
sham with irredeemably false dialogue—out of character, out of scene, void
of feeling, void of truth.
    Dialogue takes work. Compare the effort to bring someone to mind with
words (“my cousin Judy”) to the task of first conjuring up a glowing image
of your cousin—her Alice-blue eyes, and the almost Asian shape they take
when she smiles—then holding her living picture before your mind while
you rummage through your vocabulary, searching for the perfect words to
make your vision of Judy shine in the minds of your readers. Writing
vividly for the outer eye and ear of a spectator or for the inner eye and ear
of a reader demands fierce concentration.
    The language-bound art of writing aims its effects at the mental cortex
that deciphers words. To tell a story in pure image runs contrary to writing’s
psycholinguistic nature. Therefore, the masters of page, stage, and screen
dedicate their lives to doing exactly that. They choose the strenuous,
indeed, next-to-impossible technique. To inspire excellence, to create an
insightful, original telling, the dedicated writer condemns himself to chain-
gang labor, a long dig down the back roads of the unconscious in search of
vigorous, deep-image language.
    Sensory dialogue resonates with the speaker’s inner life. Specific, vivid,
image-rich language leads the reader/audience to the character’s subtext of
hidden, unconscious thoughts and feelings. As a result, when such
characters take verbal actions in pursuit of their desires, they become
transparent and we can know them in depth. But when characters sound like
a business report—generic, literal, Latinate, polysyllabic—their language
flattens the action and diminishes the scene’s inner life. The more opaque
the characters become, the more we lose interest. Therefore, even if a
character is in fact a bore, his dialogue must express his lifeless soul with
vivid dreariness.
LOCUTION AND CHARACTERIZATION

Character-specific locutions depend on both sides of a sentence, subject and
predicate. Subject (what or whom the sentence is about) and predicate
(something about the subject) combine to create a line of dialogue that
helps express two primary dimensions of characterization: knowledge and
personality. One aspect of the line tends to convey the former, and the other,
the latter.
    Although characterization can be expressed through dialogue in a
variety of ways, a character’s knowledge tends to be expressed in the names
of things, nouns and verbs, while a character’s personality tends to be
expressed in the modifiers that color those nouns and verbs.
    Knowledge. If a character uses a vague phrase such as “a big nail,” we
sense that his knowledge of carpentry is limited. Generic nouns suggest
ignorance. But if he names the thing—“shank,” “clout,” “spike,” “corker,”
“sinker”—we sense a much fuller knowledge.
    The same principle applies to verbs. Core verbs (as opposed to modal
verbs) span from generic to specific. If a character remembers that someone
“moved slowly across the room,” we sense that his recall is dull. Generic
verbs also suggest ignorance. But if his dialogue sharpens and he says that
another man “sauntered,” “waltzed,” “padded,” “slouched,” “moseyed,”
“pranced,” or “dragged himself” across the room, his choice of verb
suggests a vivid memory and insight into the other man. Specific names of
objects and actions convey a superior mentality.
    Personality. The idiosyncratic by-products of a character’s life
experience—his beliefs, his attitudes, his individuality—are chiefly
expressed through modifiers.
    First, adjectives. Two characters look at a fireworks display. One
describes it as “big” and the other as “stupendous.” These are two very
different personalities.
    Second, adverbs. Two characters watch a motorcycle go by. One says it
was going “ferociously” and the other says it was moving “quickly.” Again,
two very different people.
    Third, voice. Core verbs also span the spectrum that runs from active to
passive. In active sentences, the thing doing the action is the subject, and
the thing receiving the action is the object. Passive sentences reverse this so
that the object becomes the subject. As a result, someone who tends to use
phrases such as “The family planned the wedding” (active) versus someone
who would remember the event as “The wedding was planned by the
family” (passive) have two very different feelings about how things work in
life, two very different temperaments.
    Fourth, modals. Modal verbs (could, can, may, might, must, ought, shall,
should, will, would) attach to core verbs to add qualities of modality:
ability, possibility, obligation, permission, and the like. Modal phrases
convey:

    1. A character’s sense of self and the world around him.
    2. His feelings for his place in society and the interplay of
       relationships.
    3. His view to the past, present, and future.
    4. His attitudes toward what is possible, what is permitted, and what is
       necessary.

   Someone who says “The family could plan the wedding” versus
someone who insists “All weddings must be planned by families” are
probably two very different personalities.


PRINCIPLE OF CHARACTER-SPECIFIC DIALOGUE

Nouns and verbs express a character’s intellectual life and range of
knowledge. Modifiers (adjectives, adverbs, voice, modalities) express his
emotional life and personality.
   To figure out how your character’s personality expresses itself, ask:
“How does my character see life? Passive? Active? How does my character
modify subjects and especially predicates?” Before your fingers hit the
keys, constantly ask: “What words, phrases, and images would make my
character’s dialogue his alone? What in the psyche, life experience, and
education of my character will express the content of his knowledge (names
of nouns and verbs) and the one-of-a-kind mannerisms of his personality
(modifiers and modalities)?”


CULTURE AND CHARACTERIZATION

To answer these questions, consider this: Through the totality of your
character’s living hours, awake and sleeping, his or her mind, conscious and
unconscious, has absorbed an immense and character-specific volume of
culture: a combination of language, family, society, art, sport, religion, and
the like.
   Year after year, life’s events have hurt, rewarded, and influenced your
character in countless ways. Into this sea of customs and encounters, the
character has mixed the dispositions and physical givens he or she was
handed at birth: attractive/plain, healthy/ailing, aggressive/shy, high IQ/low
IQ, and so on. The result is a specific admixture of genes and life
experience that makes each character unlike any other character and gives
him or her a singular voice.
   In the four case studies that follow, notice what their authors found when
they entered into their characters’ psyches: popular culture. In The Tragedy
of Julius Caesar, Shakespeare references the Colossus of Rhodes, which
was the most famous, and certainly the largest, bronze statue of the classical
era, which in turn means that the well-traveled Cassius and Brutus must
have sailed past it in awe. In Out of Sight Elmore Leonard weaves images
from THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, a hit film in the Watergate era.
His characters probably saw it in their impressionable teens. Passages from
30 ROCK feature upper-class obsessions like yachts and mergers. Fine
wine, on the other hand, is no longer the province of the rich;
schoolteachers are as expert as sommeliers, which plays crucially in
SIDEWAYS.
   To write each scene, the author has gone inside to see what his character
has seen. He then discovered a cultural icon to enrich the scene as the
character draws an analogy between his immediate life and a work of art or
cuisine. Once again, using a third thing to create a trialogue.
   Think about it: How in fact do people express themselves in words?
How do they explain what they’re thinking and feeling, say what needs to
be said, and, most importantly, do what needs to be done? Answer: They
use the bits and pieces of everything they know. And what, first and
foremost, do they know? Culture. Whether popular or esoteric, whether
acquired from formal education or overheard on a street corner, culture is
our dominant source of knowledge. To that we add all the imagery rooted in
characters’ encounters with nature, cityscapes, workscapes, and religious
ritual. Plus images from dreams, from fantasies about the future, from the
totality of the day and night musings that weave these familiarities together.
This mass of experience creates a treasure chest of images that will inspire
distinctive dialogue in the mouths of your characters.
    The next four case studies illustrate these principles.

               FOUR CASE STUDIES


THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR

Consider this setup: Senator A is powerful and popular. The envious
Senator B wants the respected Senator C to join forces against Senator A.
So Senator B pulls Senator C aside to persuade him:

                                          SENATOR B
        Senator A is so popular and so powerful that compared to him, we’re nobodies.

    Senator B states the obvious in passive and opaque language. His
dialogue couldn’t be less persuasive, less imaginative, less interesting. The
comparison he makes might irritate Senator C, but Senator B’s words have
no imagery to give them life; no subtext to give them depth. His complaint
is so bland, Senator C could easily shrug it aside.
    Here’s how history’s greatest dialogue artist rendered the moment in The
Tragedy of Julius Caesar, Act 1, Scene 2:

                                            CASSIUS
                                           (to Brutus)
        Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a Colossus, and we petty men
        walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonorable graves.
   Shakespeare’s Cassius hugely overstates the case, which, of course, is
what people do when trying to wheedle their way inside someone else’s
head. They use the techniques of rhetoric to distort, exaggerate, or
manipulate.
   The Colossus was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
More than one hundred feet tall, this bronze statue of the sun god Helios
stood astride the harbor at Rhodes with ships sailing in and out of port
under its legs. Cassius compares Caesar to an awesome, imaginary colossus
that would have one foot in Spain, the other in Syria, and the whole
Mediterranean world between its legs.
   And yet, note that Shakespeare gives Cassius this phrase: “the narrow
world.” The instinctive, off-the-top-of-the-head phrase would be “the wide
world.” So, why “narrow”?
   Because Shakespeare (I suspect) wrote in-character. He slipped his
imagination into the mind of Cassius, so he could work from Cassius’s
subjective point of view. He was then able to see the world the way Cassius
saw it and write imagistic dialogue for the eye: “the narrow world.”
   As Roman senators, Cassius and Brutus would have imperial maps
spread across their desks. Every week they receive strategic reports from all
corners of the empire. These men know exactly how wide the world is: the
width of all things Roman. To the naive, the world may seem wide, but to
these urbane politicos, it’s narrow. So slender, in fact, a single man—the
ambitious Caesar—could seize it and rule it alone.
   While immersing himself in his characters, Shakespeare must have
imagined, even researched, their childhoods, for it was in their educations
that he found his inspiration for crafting the play’s unique dialogue.
   Aristocratic Roman schoolchildren were rigorously trained as orators, as
future politicians skilled in the arts of declamation, persuasion, and rhetoric.
And the guiding tenet of public speaking is, “Think as a wise man but speak
as a common man.” Speak, in other words, in the plain, monosyllabic
manner of the street.
   So note that of the twenty-eight words in Cassius’s sentence, only two
have more than two syllables.
   Shakespeare knew that seasoned orators string short words together to
create the effect of casual, artless, sincere ease while at the same time
showing off their verbal ingenuity. For it takes skill to deliver
monosyllables in a natural, pleasing rhythm. And Cassius is very clever. In
fact, all of the play’s characters have a way with simple words. The
dialogue style throughout The Tragedy of Julius Caesar is almost
exclusively monosyllabic, with some of Shakespeare’s passages stringing
thirty or more monosyllables in a row.1
    What’s more, as patrician senators, Cassius and Brutus have immense
pride in their aristocratic heritage. The notion of seeming “petty,” of
“peeping about” in search of a “dishonorable” grave repels the noble
Brutus. With these biting images, Cassius seduces him to assassinate
Caesar.
    In terms of the modal side of dialogue, because Cassius is a bold, hard-
thinking man on a mission, he uses direct action verbs: bestride, walk, peep.
He does not modify his predicates. If he did, it might read like this:
                                            CASSIUS
        It seems to me as if mighty Caesar could bestride the narrow world like some kind
        of gigantic Colossus, so we poor men would have to walk carefully around under
        his huge legs, and try to peep about to maybe, should we get really lucky, someday
        find ourselves disgusting, dishonorable graves.

    This Cassius, as I’ve rewritten him, becomes weak and nervous. He’s so
preoccupied with what’s possible and not possible, what’s permitted and not
permitted, what’s sure and unsure, that he surrounds his verbs with “could,”
“would,” “should,” and other cautious supplementary phrases.
    Lastly, very importantly, consider the background desires that surround
Cassius and the gentlemanly restraints that shape his behavior. He knows
that Brutus is a very private man, taciturn yet perceptive. Both men have
been raised in an elite society in which cultured men do not bare their souls
to each other. Therefore, to write in-character, Shakespeare must have given
thought and feeling to what his character would not say. For example, the
refined Cassius would not speak on-the-nose:
                                            CASSIUS
        I loathe that power-grabbing Caesar, and I know you hate the bastard, too. So
        before we end up begging on our knees, kissing his tyrant’s ass, let’s murder the
        son of a bitch.
   With the exception of hip-hop lyrics, the twenty-first century seems
poetry-lite. Shakespearean iambic pentameter may feel out of reach;
nonetheless, we want our scenes to play with an intensity that matches the
emotional lives of our characters and, in turn, moves the reader/audience.
To achieve this, we take inspiration from Shakespeare to enrich our
dialogue with imagery. First, we visualize the scene from our character’s
subjective point of view, and then find language from within his nature and
experience to create his character-specific dialogue.


OUT OF SIGHT

Consider this setup: During a prison break, a criminal forces a federal agent
into the trunk of her car and climbs in with her. His partner takes the wheel
and drives off. While sardined in the pitch-dark trunk, crook and cop are
irresistibly attracted. After the getaway, neither can stop thinking about the
other. Eventually she tracks him to a hotel where, despite their antagonistic
roles, their mutual passion moves them to declare a truce and spend a
romantic evening together.

     INT. LUXURY HOTEL ROOM—NIGHT

     Candlelight glints off the dewy eyes of the handsome Criminal and beautiful Federal
     Agent as they gaze longingly at each other.


                                         FEDERAL AGENT
         I’m confused and scared.

                                             CRIMINAL
         Same here, but I’m trying to be cool.

                                         FEDERAL AGENT
         Me, too, but I’m afraid that you might rape me.

                                             CRIMINAL
         Never. My only hope is to have a nice romantic night together.
                                        FEDERAL AGENT
         Good. Because underneath your tough exterior I suspect there’s a really loving guy.
         But still I can’t be certain. Maybe you’re trying to seduce me so I’ll help you
         escape the law.

                                            CRIMINAL
         No, I understand you’re still a federal agent and I’m still a bank robber and you
         have your job to do. It’s just that you’re so beautiful, I can’t stop thinking about
         how it was when we met.

     They sigh and take a sad sip of champagne.

   I’ve written this scene in the paralytic language of people saying exactly
and completely what they think and feel. The result? A flattened wreck no
actor could salvage. Explicit dialogue that turns a character’s inner life into
words turns an actor to wood.
   In contrast to the scene I sketched above, here is how Elmore Leonard,
one of the finest writers of dialogue in the modern novel, rendered the
cop/criminal tryst:
   In Chapter Twenty of Out of Sight, escaped bank robber Jack Foley
invites US Marshal Karen Sisco to a hotel suite overlooking the Detroit
waterfront. They drink and reminisce about the prison break and their
dangerous, yet erotic encounter in the trunk of her car:

       She said, “Remember how talkative you were?”
       He said, “I was nervous,” lighting her cigarette and then his own.
       “Yeah, but you didn’t show it. You were a pretty cool guy. But
   then when you got in the trunk… I thought you’d try to tear my
   clothes off.”
       “It never entered my mind. Well, not until—remember we were
   talking about Faye Dunaway?… I told you I liked that movie Three
   Days of the Condor, and you said yeah, you loved the lines? Like the
   next morning, after they’d slept together, he says he’ll need her help
   and she says…”
       “Have I ever denied you anything?”
       “I thought for a couple of seconds there, the way you said it, you
   were coming on to me.”
       “Maybe I was and didn’t know it… Before they ever go to bed
   she accused him of getting rough. He says, ‘What? Have I raped
   you?’ And she says, ‘The night is young.’ I thought, Come on—what
   is she doing, giving him ideas?”
       “You know you kept touching me, feeling my thigh.”
       “Yeah, but in a nice way.”
       “You called me your zoo-zoo.”
       “That’s candy, inside, something sweet.”

    In this deceptively simple but complex scene, Leonard’s dialogue
creates multiple layers of textual imagery over a double layer of implied
images. The first two layers are set up in the previous pages:
    Layer 1. The image of the setting: For his long-fantasized rendezvous
with Karen, Foley chooses a posh hotel suite that commands a panorama of
the city at night under a gentle snowfall. Soft lights, soft music. They’re
posed like a chic couple on a Crown Royal whisky billboard. Leonard
delights in setting up this glitzy cliché so that he can ironize and undercut it
again and again.
    Layer 2. The all-too-familiar image of the situation: Their romance is
“illegal.” Foley is a felon on the run; Sisco is the law. But this has been
done many times before: McQueen and Dunaway in THE THOMAS
CROWN AFFAIR, Bogie and Bacall in DARK PASSAGE, Grant and
Hepburn in CHARADE. It’s not just any cliché; it’s a movie cliché.
    And then the dialogue takes over to add more facets.
    Layer 3. Escape from “reality”: Over their movie scene Foley and
Sisco superimpose yet another movie—THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR.
They chat about their favorite moments from the film because they’re fully
aware that they’re living in a virtual film. As a result, the reader blends the
famous faces of Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway with the fictional faces
of Foley and Sisco, coating the whole episode with Hollywood gloss.
    Layer 4. The memory: The lovers replay their intimate adventure in
her car trunk. This takes us back to the mini-movie that ran through our
head when we read the prison break scene in the opening chapters.
    Now four layers of images are superimposed on the reader’s mind: The
hotel setting, the cop/criminal situation, the Hollywood version, and the
burnished nostalgia of how they met. But that’s only the surface.
    Beneath this, Leonard creates his characters’ inner lives of unspoken
needs and dreams.
    Leonard uses a pair of third things: THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR
and the memory of their first adventure. These play back-to-back to create
interlocking trialogues. As I laid out in Part Two, working a scene through a
third thing helps keep dialogue off-the-nose.
    Layer 5. The subtext: Under the lines, we sense Jack and Karen’s
desire to put aside their cop/criminal roles, to take time out from life, so
they can indulge this rush of romance. We can well imagine their sexual
fantasies clashing with the realization that their intimacy is tabooed. This in
turn makes their sensual desires dangerous, even lethal, and so all the more
erotic. Could either of them name what they’re feeling? No. No one could
and still feel it. To name a feeling is to kill it.
    The present is so razor sharp, Leonard has them sidestep it by
reminiscing about how they met. But as they do, everything they say about
the past betrays a subtext of what they’re feeling in the now.
    They kid about the heart-pounding jailbreak and how they played it
cool, but for all Karen knows she’s sitting on a sofa with a smooth-talking
rapist, and for all Jack knows there’s a SWAT team with a battering ram
outside the door. They tease offhandedly about the sexy tension they felt in
the trunk of her car, while the heat of the moment blisters the hotel room.
And, very importantly, they hide all this behind witty quotes from THREE
DAYS OF THE CONDOR.
    It’s at this fifth layer of the unspoken that Leonard unites Karen and
Jack. We realize that although they’re on opposite sides of the law, at heart
they’re a matched pair of die-hard romantics hooked on old movies.
    Layer 6. Dreams: This subtextual insight leads us to imagine the
wistful daydreams of Foley and Sisco. While he hopes that she will play
Faye Dunaway to his Robert Redford and somehow rescue him, he knows
that in fact that will never happen. Sisco can see herself as Dunaway acting
out that scenario; it’s her wish, too. But like Foley, she knows it’s an
impossible fantasy.
    Leonard must have loved dialogue or he couldn’t have written it with
such skill. So note that his characters also love dialogue. When he has them
remember THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, they don’t recall looks or
gestures; they quote lines verbatim—lines that must have struck Leonard’s
ear when he saw the film.
   What is the payoff to the deep insight this scene gives the reader?
   Enormous suspense: Will they make love? Will she forget she’s a cop
and let him escape? Will she arrest him? Will she have to shoot him? Will
he be forced to kill her? This seemingly casual talk between forbidden
lovers expresses all of the above and more.


30 ROCK

                 Season 5, Episode 1, “The Fabian Strategy”

This half-hour comedy series takes place in the offices and studios of NBC
in New York’s Rockefeller Center.
    John Francis “Jack” Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) serves as vice president of
East Coast television and microwave oven programming for General
Electric. Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) works for Jack as producer and head writer
of a prime-time variety show. Avery (Elizabeth Banks) is Jack’s fiancée.
    The passages below sample Jack’s verbal style. The phrases and words
in bold signal his unique characterization and hint at his true character.
    On his first morning back from summer vacation, Jack calls Liz on the
phone:
                                             JACK
        Oh, Lemon, Avery and I just got back from the most amazing vacation on Paul
        Allen’s yacht. Sheer bliss. Avery is the most perfect woman ever created. Like a
        young Bo Derek stuffed with a Barry Goldwater. (pause) But it’s back to reality.
        No more making love on the beach surrounded by a privacy circle of English-
        trained butlers.

   (Note: Paul Allen co-founded Microsoft.)
   In a meeting later that day with Liz and her show’s producers, Jack fears
that the network’s weak performance will jeopardize an all-important
merger:
                                             JACK
       In order for our merger to stay attractive to our friends at Kabletown, we have to
       seem like a sexy, profitable company, and we’re almost pulling it off. The
       Harry Potter Theme Park is a huge hit with both anglophiles and pedophiles.
       The movie division has a James Cameron movie the whole world will see
       whether they like it or not. Only NBC continues to be the engorged whitehead
       on the otherwise flawless face of Universal Media.

   As their workday ends, Liz confesses that she suffers relationship
problems, so Jack gives her this advice:

                                             JACK
       You can’t just do the vacation part. At some point you have to go home to the
       same house, unpack your dirty laundry, and have a life together. And one of you
       says, “We should redecorate.” And the other says, “Please, Avery, I’m using the
       commode right now.”

                                              LIZ
       Oh, she wants to redecorate? She just moved in.

                                             JACK
       Avery has opinions. I love her for that. Unfortunately, she wants to repaint the
       upstairs hallway in a striae faux finish called “Husk.” I prefer the color that’s
       already there, a reddish brown shade called “Elk Tongue.”

                                              LIZ
       So tell her “No.” It’s your house.

                                             JACK
       This is how I know you’ve never had an adult relationship. If I say “No,” then I
       will be required to say “Yes” to something else in the future and the stakes in the
       future might be higher.

                                              LIZ
       Then say “Yes.”

                                             JACK
       If I give in, then I’m no longer the alpha in my house. Before you know it, she’ll
        have me wearing jeans and reading fiction.

                                                 LIZ
        Yeah, well, “Yes” and “No” are kind of your only two choices.

                                                JACK
        For most men, sure, but there is a third option—the Fabian Strategy… The
        Fabian Strategy derives its name from the Roman general Quintus Fabius
        Maximus. He ran away, Lemon. Rather than engage in battle, he would retreat and
        retreat until the enemy grew fatigued and eventually made a mistake. Although
        I abhor it as a military strategy, it is the basis for all my personal relationships.

    Jack’s handsome face, tailored suits, and $150 haircuts suggest who he
might be, but beyond his physical appearance, the writers draw on terms
such as “sheer bliss,” “flawless,” “Bo Derek,” “a sexy, profitable company,”
“privacy circle,” “commode,” “Husk,” “Elk Tongue,” “prefer,” and “abhor”
to nail his characterization. Modal phrases such as “no more,” “like it or
not,” “you can’t,” “you have to,” and “if/then” signal Jack’s sense of power
over others. The word and phrase choices in these speeches attest to Jack’s
command of popular culture, his excellent education, his identification with
the upper class, his capitalist ethos, his controlling executive leadership
style, and, most of all, his supercilious, egoistic snobbery. Together, these
traits etch the outer self he shows the world—his characterization.
    But vocabulary and syntax also throw light on character dimension.
    A dimension is a contradiction that underpins a character’s nature. These
psychological stanchions come in two kinds: 1) Contradictions that play
characterization against true character. Namely, conflicts between a
character’s outer traits and his inner truths, between the persona of his
visible behavior and the person he hides behind the mask. 2) Contradictions
that play self against self. These dimensions link the warring forces within
true, deep character—most often desires from the conscious self at odds
with opposite impulses from the subconscious self.2
    Jack’s speech style reveals seven such dimensions: He’s 1) socially
sophisticated (Paul Allen’s yacht/English-trained butlers) yet privately
primal (the alpha in my house/engorged whitehead), 2) unscrupulous (The
movie division has a James Cameron movie the whole world will see
whether they like it or not) yet guilt-ridden (I will be required to say “Yes”),
3) fiscally conservative (Barry Goldwater) yet risk taking (The Harry Potter
Theme Park is a huge hit with both anglophiles and pedophiles), 4) well
educated (General Quintus Fabius Maximus invented his guerrilla strategy
during the Second Punic War in 218 BC) yet self-deceived (the basis for all
my personal relationships), and 5) intellectually pompous (a striae faux
finish) yet factually informed (a striae faux finish). Jack 6) uses devious
tactics to navigate his personal life (retreat until the enemy grows fatigued
and eventually makes a mistake), yet idealizes his relationships with women
(most perfect woman ever created). He 7) is a realist (You can’t just do the
vacation part), yet a dreamer (a life together). The show’s directors
constantly posed Jack in a close-up, staring into space, imagining his
idealized future.
    Multidimensional as he is, Jack Donaghy is not, however, a dramatic
character; he is, at heart, a comic character, driven by a blind obsession.
    Both dramatic and comic characters seek an object of desire. In that they
are the same. Their core difference, however, is awareness. As a dramatic
character pursues his quest, he has sense enough to step back and realize
that his struggle could get him killed. Not the comic character: His core
desire blinds him. His self-deluded mind fixates on his desire and pursues
it, wildly unaware. This lifelong mania influences, if not controls, his every
choice.3
    Jack Donaghy blithely obsesses on an aristocratic lifestyle more suited
to the 1920s than today. “Made love on a beach surrounded by a privacy
circle of English-trained butlers” sounds like a diary entry by Wallis
Simpson before she became Duchess of Windsor. Vacationing on yachts
recalls scenes from F. Scott Fitzgerald novels. The love of his life, a fellow
aristocrat named Avery, graduated from Choate and Yale. Jack, like the
Princeton alumnus he is, disdains jeans and only reads nonfiction.
    His syntactically balanced sentences roll out rounded with relative
clauses: “In order for our merger to stay attractive to our friends at
Kabletown, we have to seem like a sexy, profitable company, and we’re
almost pulling it off,” and “If I say ‘No,’ then I will be required to say ‘Yes’
to something else in the future, and the stakes in the future might be
higher.” His dialogue sounds like a tuxedoed businessman talking shop in a
penthouse cocktail party. The tuxedo, in fact, is Jack’s eveningwear of
choice. In Season 1, Liz asks him why he’s wearing a tux in his office and
he explains, “It’s after six. What am I, a farmer?”
    Like the clothes they wear, vocabulary and syntax dress characters
inside and out.


SIDEWAYS

Rex Pickett writes both novels and films. In addition to his first novel
Sideways, and a second novel, La Purisima, he wrote the screenplay for the
2000 Oscar-winning short film MY MOTHER DREAMS THE SATAN’S
DISCIPLES IN NEW YORK.
    Screenwriters Jim Taylor and Alexander Payne earned writers’ credit on
the best-written episode of the Jurassic Park franchise, JURASSIC PARK
III. In addition, they have collaborated with great success on CITIZEN
RUTH, ELECTION, ABOUT SCHMIDT, and SIDEWAYS. More recently,
Payne wrote and directed THE DESCENDANTS (2011) and directed
NEBRASKA (2013).
    SIDEWAYS, which Payne directed from their adaptation of Pickett’s
novel, has won a long list of international nominations and awards,
including an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. As their choice of subject
matter suggests, these writers are attracted to life’s losers and their futile,
often comic struggles to win.
    SIDEWAYS is, by genre, an education plot. Four simple conventions
define this very difficult genre:

    1. The protagonist begins the story with a life-denying mindset. He
       finds no meaning in the world around him or himself in it.
    2. The story will arc the protagonist’s downbeat point of view to a
       positive, life-affirming stance.
    3. A “teacher” character will help guide the protagonist’s revolution in
       attitude.
    4. The story’s greatest source of conflict will come from the
       protagonist’s beliefs, emotions, habits, and attitudes—in other
       words, from an inner conflict with his own self-destructive nature.

    The education plot is a natural genre for a novel because prose allows
the writer to directly invade a character’s deepest thoughts and feelings. In
Pickett’s first-person novel, for example, his protagonist whispers his secret
fears and doubts directly into the reader’s ear. Onscreen, however, this
literary form becomes extremely difficult, requiring superb dialogue to
imply within a character what the novelist can explicitly state on page.
    The screenplay’s protagonist, Miles, is a pudgy, divorced, failed novelist
who teaches junior high school English. Although no one makes the
accusation onscreen, he’s clearly an alcoholic who hides his dependency
behind the mask of (in Miles’s words from the novel) a wine cognoscente.
The title SIDEWAYS is never explained in the film, but in the novel
“sideways” is slang for drunk. To “go sideways” means to get very, very
drunk.
    The “teacher” role is filled by the intelligent and beautiful Maya, who’s
also divorced, also a wine lover. Midway through the film, Miles and Maya
spend an evening with Miles’s pal, Jack, and Maya’s friend, Stephanie.
They all end up at Stephanie’s house. When Jack and Stephanie retire to the
bedroom, Miles and Maya sit in the living room sipping a wine from
Stephanie’s excellent collection. At first they chat about how they met (he
was a customer in a restaurant where she waits tables), then the subject
turns first to Miles (his novel), then to Maya (her MA in agrology), and,
finally, to their mutual love of wine.

                                               MAYA
         Why are you so obsessed with Pinot? That’s all you ever order.

     Miles smiles wistfully at the question. He searches for the answer in his glass and begins
     slowly.

                                               MILES
         I don’t know. It’s a hard grape to grow. As you know. It’s thin-skinned,
         temperamental. It’s not a survivor like Cabernet that can grow and thrive
         anywhere… and withstand neglect. Pinot’s only happy in specific little corners of
         the world, and it needs a lot of doting. Only the patient and faithful and caring
    growers can do it, can access Pinot’s fragile, achingly beautiful qualities. It doesn’t
    come to you. You have to come to it, see? It takes the right combination of soil and
    sun… and love to coax it into its fullest expression. Then, and only then, its flavors
    are the most thrilling and brilliant and haunting on the planet.

Maya has found this answer revealing and moving.

                                            MILES
                                          (CONT’D)
    I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for
    some reason. By comparison. How about you, why do you like wine so much?

                                            MAYA
    I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big,
    kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and
    the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.

                                            MILES
    Yeah? Like what?

                                            MAYA
    I started to appreciate the life of wine, that it’s a living thing, that it connects you
    more to life. I like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were
    growing. I like to think about how the sun was shining that summer and what the
    weather was like. I think about all those people who tended and picked the grapes.
    And if it’s an old wine, how many of them must be dead by now. I love how wine
    continues to evolve, how every time I open a bottle the wine will taste different
    than if I had uncorked it on any other day, or at any other moment. A bottle of wine
    is like life itself—it grows up, evolves and gains complexity. Then it peaks—like
    your ’61—and begins its steady, inexorable decline. And it tastes so fucking good.

Now it’s Miles’s turn to be swept away. Maya’s face tells us the moment is right, but
Miles remains frozen. He needs another sign, and Maya is bold enough to offer it: she
reaches out and places one hand atop his.

                                            MILES
    But I like a lot of wines besides Pinot too. Lately I’ve really been into Rieslings.
         Do you like Rieslings?

     She nods, a Mona Lisa smile on her lips.

                                                 MILES
                                                (pointing)
         Bathroom over there?

                                                 MAYA
         Yeah.

     Miles gets up and walks out. Maya sighs and gets an American Spirit out of her purse.

    Like the scene from Leonard’s Out of Sight, this is a seduction, but in
this case between two very sensitive people—the sage earth mother, Maya,
and the emotional wallflower, Miles. Like the scene from LOST IN
TRANSLATION below, it’s an exchange of revelations. But they are not
confessing personal failures; rather, the underlying actions of both
characters are bragging and promising. Miles and Maya try hard to sell their
virtues to each other.
    In the subtext of Miles’s big speech, he invites Maya to come to him,
and in the subtext of her reply she does, and brilliantly. So that she leaves
no doubt about her desire for him, she even touches his hand and smiles a
“Mona Lisa” come-on. But Miles chickens out, bolts for the toilet, and
leaves her in frustration.
    Once again, note how the scene is designed around a trialogue. Wine
becomes the third thing under which the subtext pulses.
    Now I’ll rewrite their speeches on-the-nose, pulling the bragging and
promising from the subtext and putting it directly into the text by
eliminating the third thing.

                                                 MILES
         I’m a hard guy to get to know. I’m thin-skinned and temperamental. I’m not tough,
         not a hard-hearted survivor. I need a cozy, safe little world and a woman who will
         dote on me. But if you are patient and faithful and caring, you will bring out my
         beautiful qualities. I cannot come to you. You must come to me. Do you
         understand? With the right kind of coaxing love I will turn into the most thrilling
        and brilliant man you could ever have the luck to know.

                                                MAYA
        I am a woman with a passion for life. Hour after hour, day after day, season after
        season, I thrive in the golden light of time, savoring its every precious spell. I am in
        my prime—old enough to have learned from mistakes, young enough to grow and
        evolve, so that with every passing day I will become ever more complex, ever more
        amazing. When I peak, and believe me, I am peaking at this very moment with you,
        I will taste good, oh so very, very good. Please fuck me.

    A person might feel such feelings, might even think such thoughts in
some vague way, but no one would ever say these embarrassingly painful
things aloud. This bald language becomes impossibly corny when put
directly into a living room chat about ideas and yearnings. Fine actors
would choke on it.
    Yet these are exactly the actions that Taylor and Payne want their
characters to take: To put themselves in the very best light and to promise
the moon in an effort to win the love of the other with seductive boasts and
promises. So, how to write these beats of action into dialogue? Let them
converse.
    How do people converse? By using what they know as a third thing.
And what do these characters know? Miles and Maya are experts on two
subjects: wine and themselves. They have extensive, practical knowledge of
the former and romanticized, idealized knowledge of the latter. So using the
nature of wine and its cultivation as metaphor for their own natures, they
each campaign to win the esteem of the other.
    As I laid out in the beginning of this section, the key is vocabulary.
Character-specific dialogue originates in a character’s unspoken desires and
the actions he takes to satisfy those desires. Actions become talk that
translates the character’s implicit thoughts and feelings into explicit words
—the precise words that only that specific character would use at that
specific moment taking that specific action.
    Drawing on Pickett’s novel, Payne and Taylor have added their
knowledge and insight to Miles and Maya and given each a character-
specific voice and vocabulary. In order to seduce, Miles and Maya describe
themselves in the language of wine. Compare, for example, Miles’s modal
language, his sensitive adjectives and adverbs, to Maya’s bold naming, her
nouns and verbs.
    Miles: “Thin-skinned,” “temperamental,” “doting,” “faithful,” “caring,”
“fragile,” “have to come to,” “achingly beautiful,” “thrilling,” “brilliant,”
“haunting,” “really been into…”
    Maya: “Life,” “living thing,” “connects to life,” “life itself,” “sun,”
“shining,” “summer,” “evolves,” “gains,” “peaks,” “tastes so fucking
good…”
    These writers have an ear for their characters.
     PART 4




DIALOGUE DESIGN
                                    12


         STORY/SCENE/DIALOGUE


Now and then, we experience a flawed story that squandered surprisingly
good dialogue. We have all waded through badly told stories with dreadful
dialogue, but we rarely encounter a superbly told story ruined by lousy
dialogue. And the reason is simple: Quality storytelling inspires quality
dialogue.
   Like a hectic fever, bad dialogue warns of a festering infection deep
within a story. But because struggling writers often mistake the symptom
for the disease, they try to bandage scenes by obsessively rewriting their
dialogue, thinking that once the talk is right, the telling will heal. But
maladies of character and event cannot be cured by scratching dialogue raw
with draft after draft of paraphrases.
   To put it as clearly as I can: Until you know what you are talking about,
you cannot know how your characters go about talking. The order in which
you create your story’s components and how you bring all these pieces
together is unique to you. But no matter how helter-skelter the process, an
author ultimately gathers godlike knowledge of form (event and cast
design) and content (cultural, historical, and psychological substance) to
support the telling from the bottom up, to create dialogue from the inside
out. Dialogue is the final step, the frosting of text atop layers and layers of
subtext.
   So, before we examine dialogue design, let’s review the basic
components of story design.


INCITING INCIDENT

At the opening of a story, the central character’s life rests in a state of
relative balance. She has her ups and downs. Who doesn’t? Nonetheless, the
protagonist holds reasonable sovereignty over her existence—until
something happens that radically upsets that equilibrium. We call this event
the inciting incident.
    To incite means to start; “incident” means “event.” This first major event
starts the story by throwing the protagonist’s life out of kilter. The inciting
incident could happen by decision (she decides to quit her job and open her
own business) or by coincidence (lightning strikes her store and she loses
her business). The inciting incident could move her life powerfully to the
positive (she invents a brilliant new product) or to the negative (a business
rival steals her invention). The inciting incident could be a massive social
event (her corporation goes bankrupt) or a quiet inner event (she comes to
realize in her heart of hearts that she hates her career).1


STORY VALUES

The impact of the inciting incident decisively changes the charge of the
value at stake in the character’s life. Story values are binaries of
positive/negative charge such as life/death, courage/cowardice, truth/lie,
meaningfulness/meaninglessness,       maturity/immaturity,      hope/despair,
justice/injustice, to name but a few. A story may incorporate any number,
variety, and possible combinations of story values, but it anchors its content
in an irreplaceable core value.
    A core value is irreplaceable because it determines the story’s
fundamental nature. Change core value, change the genre. For example, if a
writer were to extract love/hate from her characters’ lives and substitute
morality/immorality, this switch in core values would pivot her genre from
love story to redemption plot.
    The values in scenes can be very complex, but at minimum, every scene
contains at least one story value at stake in the character’s life. This value
either relates to or matches the story’s core value. Scenes dramatize change
in the charge of this value. A scene may begin with its value(s) at either a
purely positive charge, purely negative charge, or an admixture of both.
Through conflicts and/or revelations, the opening charge of value(s)
changes. It could reverse (positive to negative, negative to positive),
intensify (positive to doubly positive, negative to doubly negative), or wane
(purely positive to a weaker positive, purely negative to a weaker negative).
The precise moment in which the charge of one or more values changes is a
scene’s turning point. Therefore, a story event occurs the instant a value at
stake in a scene changes charge.2


THE COMPLEX OF DESIRE

Everyone wants reasonable sovereignty over existence. By throwing life out
of balance, the inciting incident arouses the natural human desire to restore
balance. Essentially, therefore, all stories dramatize the human struggle to
move life from chaos to order, from imbalance to equilibrium.
    Characters act because needs demand deeds, but the complexity of life
swirls through a labyrinth of desires. Ultimately the art of storytelling
merges and organizes many streams of desire into a flow of events. The
storyteller picks and chooses only those desires he wishes to express in the
specific scenes that progress his story from beginning to end. To understand
this process, we need to examine the components of desire and how they
propel storytelling.
    Desire is a figure in five dimensions:

    1. Object of desire
    2. Super-intention
    3. Motivation
    4. Scene intention
    5. Background desires
1. Object of Desire
In the wake of the inciting incident, the protagonist conceives of an object
of desire, that which he feels he must have in order to put his life back on
an even keel. This object could be something physical, like a stash of
money; or situational, like revenge for an injustice; or ideational, like a faith
to live by. Example: A humiliation on the job (inciting incident) has
damaged the protagonist’s reputation, radically upsetting the balance of his
life, so he seeks a victory in the workplace (object of desire) to restore
balance.


2. Super-Intention
The super-intention motivates a character to pursue the object of desire.
This phrase restates the protagonist’s conscious desire in terms of his
deepest need. For example, the object of desire above (victory in the
workplace) rephrased as the super-intention becomes: to gain inner peace
through a public triumph.
    In other words, the object of desire is objective, whereas the super-
intention is subjective: what the protagonist wants versus the emotional
hunger that drives him. The former term gives the writer a clear view of the
crisis scene that waits at the end of the story when the protagonist will get
or fail to get his object of desire. The latter term connects the writer to the
feelings within the protagonist, the inner need that drives the telling.
    In every story, the protagonist’s super-intention is somewhat generic (for
example, to win justice through revenge, to find happiness in intimate love,
to live a meaningful life), but the exact object of desire (for example, a dead
villain, the ideal mate, a reason not to commit suicide) gives a story
originality. Whatever the object of desire may be, the protagonist wants it
because he must satisfy his super-intention, his profound longing for a life
in balance.


3. Motivation
Do not confuse either object of desire or super-intention with motivation.
The first two answer “what” questions: What does the character consciously
want? What does he subconsciously need? Motivation answers “why.” Why
does a character need what he feels he needs? Why does he want his
particular object of desire? And if he gets what he wants, will this success
actually satisfy his need?
   The roots of motivation reach deep into childhood and, for that reason,
are often irrational. How much you understand the whys of your character’s
needs and wants is up to you. Some writers, like Tennessee Williams,
obsess on motivation; some writers, like Shakespeare, ignore it. Either way,
what’s essential to the writing of scenes and their dialogue is an
understanding of the characters’ conscious and subconscious desires.3

4. Scene Intention
A scene shapes a character’s moment-by-moment struggle toward his
ultimate life goal. Scene intention names what a character immediately
wants as a step in the long-term effort of the super-intention. As a result, the
actions he takes and the reactions he gets in each scene will either take him
closer to or bend him farther away from his object of desire.
    If the writer were to grant the character his scene intention, the scene
would stop. For example, in a police interrogation scene, Character A wants
Character B to stop questioning him. A’s scene intention is to stop the
interrogation. If B were to give up and leave the room, the scene would end.
B, on the other hand, wants A to reveal a secret. From B’s point of view, his
scene intention is to discover the secret. If A were to confess, that too
would end the scene. Scene intention names the character’s imminent,
conscious desire—what he wants right now.4

5. Background Desires
A character’s background desires limit his choices of action. Each of us is
constantly aware of the state of the relationship between ourselves and
every person and every object we encounter in life—our safety in traffic,
which table the maître d’ gives us, our place in the hierarchy of coworkers,
to name only three public examples. We are acutely aware of our private
rapport with friends, family, and lovers. We’re also attuned to our innermost
self, our relative state of physical, mental, emotional, and moral well-being.
What’s more, we’re aware of our place in the flow of time, of our
experiences in the past, the knife-edge of the present, and what we hope for
the future. These complex interwoven relationships create our background
desires.
     Relationships become desires in this way: Once created, relationships
form the foundation of our existence; they create the system that gives us
our sense of identity and security in life. Our well-being depends on them.
We try to eliminate relationships of negative value, while at the same time
maintaining, if not improving, positive relationships. At the very least, we
want relationships of either kind kept within reasonable control.
     Background desires, therefore, not only cement the status quo of a
character’s life; they temper his behavior. Background desires form the web
of restraints that follows every character into every scene. These fixed
desires for stability limit and temper the character’s actions. They influence
what the character will or will not say to get what he wants.
     In principle, the more relationships of positive value a character
accumulates in life, the more restrained, the more “civilized” his behavior.
The reverse is also true: When a character has nothing to lose… he’s
capable of anything.
     In some cultures, because of social mores, you can speak your mind; in
other cultures, for the same reason, you must obey unspoken codes of
address and keep your thoughts to yourself. Humanity’s enormous range of
cultures creates a spectrum of polar extremes that spans from cultures that
are all subtext with hardly any text versus cultures that are all text and very
little subtext. In the social sciences, these polar extremes are known as
high-context versus low-context cultures.5 In fiction, they determine the
relative quantity of text versus subtext.
     High-context cultures have a strong sense of tradition and history. They
change very slowly over time, and so from generation to generation their
members hold many beliefs and experiences in common. A high-context
culture will be relational, collectivistic, intuitive, and contemplative. It
places high value on interpersonal relationships within a close-knit
community (Native Americans, for example).
     As a result, within these in-groups many things can be left unsaid
because their members can easily draw inferences from their shared culture
and experiences. The Italian Mafia is such an in-group. In THE
GODFATHER, when Michael Corleone says, “My father made him an offer
he couldn’t refuse,” an entire episode of extortion becomes violently clear.
Michael then goes on to make the event explicit to Kay Adams because
she’s not in the in-group.
    High-context cultures, such as those in the Middle East and Asia, have
low ethnic and social diversity. They value community over the individual.
In-group members rely on their common background, rather than words, to
explain situations. Consequently, dialogue within high-context cultures calls
for extreme economy and precise word choices because within such settings
a few subtle words can implicitly express a complex message.
    Conversely, characters in low-context cultures, such as North America,
tend to explain things at greater length because the people around them
come from a wide variety of racial, religious, class, and nationalistic
backgrounds. Even within the same general cultures these differences
appear. Compare, for example, two American stereotypes: a Louisianan (a
high-context culture) and a New Yorker (a low-context culture). The former
uses a few tacit words and prolonged silences, while the latter talks frankly
and at length.
    What’s more, in low-context cultures, shared experiences change
constantly and drastically, thus creating communication gaps from one
generation to the next. In immigrant societies, such as the United States,
parents and children have notoriously difficult communication problems
that result in long, loud arguments. Characters become more verbose and
explicit as subtext shallows out.


FORCES OF ANTAGONISM

As a character pursues her object of desire, she consciously or instinctively
designs actions that she hopes will cause helpful, enabling reactions from
her world, reactions that she expects will move her closer to a balanced life.
But instead of getting cooperation, her actions arouse forces of antagonism
that thwart her efforts. Her world reacts differently, more powerfully, in
contrast or contradiction to what she reckoned. This surprising violation of
expectation may move her further from or closer to her object of desire, but
whether positive or negative, the turn will not happen in the way she
imagined.
    The term forces of antagonism does not necessarily refer to an
antagonist or villain. Villains inhabit certain genres, and in his proper place
an arch-villain, such as the Terminator, can be a fascinating antagonist. But
by forces of antagonism I mean opposing forces from any or all of the four
levels of conflict:
    1. Physical conflict: The titanic forces of time, space, and every object
in the manmade and natural universe. Not enough time to get something
done, too far to go to get something, nature’s tumult from tornadoes to
viruses. To these natural forces, fantasy genres add supernatural and
magical forces of amazing variety and unlimited imaginings.
    2. Social conflict: The powerful forces of institutions and the people
who run them. All levels of government and the legal systems they enforce,
all religions, the military, corporations, schools, hospitals, even charities.
Every institution shapes itself into a pyramid of power. How do you gain it?
Lose it? How do you move up and down the power pyramid?
    3. Personal conflict: The problematic relationships of intimacy between
friends, family, and lovers that range from infidelity to divorce to petty
squabbles over money.
    4. Inner conflict: Contradictory forces within a character’s mind, body,
and emotions. How to cope when your memory betrays you, your body
breaks down, or your feelings overwhelm your common sense?
    Over the progressive dynamics of a story, forces from these various
levels build in power and focus, deepening and widening the story. As these
complications build, the protagonist reacts by digging deeper and deeper
into her willpower as well as her mental, emotional, and physical capacities
in an ever-escalating effort to restore life’s balance.6


SPINE OF ACTION

A story’s spine of action traces the protagonist’s constant quest for his
object of desire. His persistent pursuit, driven by his super-intention,
struggling against the story’s forces of antagonism, propels the entire telling
from the inciting incident through the story’s progressions to the
protagonist’s eventual crisis decision and climactic action, ending in a
moment of resolution.
    What the protagonist (or any character) does from scene to scene or says
from line to line is simply a behavioral tactic. For no matter what happens
on the surface, no matter what outer activity catches our eye and ear, the
protagonist’s grand, unrelenting spine of action runs under every scene.
    Because other people are the most common source of life’s
complications, the most common activity taken along the spine of action is
talk. And like the five major movements of story (inciting incident,
progressive complications, crisis, climax, resolution), talk has its own five
stages—desire, sense of antagonism, choice of action, action/reaction,
expression.
    Of these stages, expression is the activity that carries the character’s
action into his world. It’s most often speech, but it may be clenching a fist
or planting a kiss, hurling a plate across a room or smiling deceitfully—all
the nonverbal activities that may accompany or substitute for dialogue.
    Imagine this story: You are a first-time writer trying to break into the
profession. In that secret place where you hide from the world, you feel
incomplete as you teeter through life. You dream of a creative triumph that
would give you wholeness and balance: a novel, play, or script of
surpassing quality (object of desire). Your need to achieve artistic success
(super-intention) drives your writing life (spine of action).
    You sit down (scene) and pursue your desire by attempting to write a
page of dialogue (choice of action) because you hope it will unlock insight
into your characters and story events to come (scene intention). But before
you begin, you know that a pernicious horde of forces will oppose your
efforts—your mother will call, the baby will wake up, fears of failure will
churn your belly, the temptation to quit will whisper in your ear (sources of
antagonism). In the face of these forces, you choose to stay at your desk and
persevere (choice of action). And so you write and rewrite the same passage
over and over (action). But with each pass your dialogue stumbles, sputters,
and only gets worse (force of antagonism). You spew a chain of hyphenated
profanity, “Stupid damn… mother… son of a…” (expression). Suddenly,
from out of nowhere, a new angle of attack springs to mind (reaction). You
pound out dialogue that reshapes the scene with surprising power (action).
You lean back and mutter, “Wow, where did that come from?” (expression).
   Every immediate desire and action, no matter how seemingly trivial,
even a thing as infinitesimal as taking a thought-filled sip of coffee, is
somehow affixed to your future desire and your pursuit of literary
achievement. Moment by moment, your life moves along a spine of action
from desire to sense of antagonism to choice of action to action/reaction to
expression.
   As for you, so for your characters. As for your life, so for your stories.7


STORY PROGRESSION

The scenes along the spine of action not only move dynamically across the
positive/negative charges of the story’s values, but they arc along a
progression of conflict. As a character struggles toward his object of desire,
the forces of antagonism build, calling on greater and greater capacities
from within him, generating greater and greater jeopardy in his life,
demanding greater and greater willpower to make more and more risk-
taking decisions.
    Finally, there comes a moment when the protagonist has exhausted all
possible actions, save one. Faced with the most powerful and focused
conflict of his life, the protagonist must choose one final action in a last
effort to put his life back in balance. He makes his crisis decision, chooses a
climactic action, and takes it. Out of the climax he either gets what he wants
or fails to get it. End of story. A last resolution scene may be needed to tie
up any loose ends and let the reader/audience gather their thoughts and
recoup their emotions.8


TURNING POINTS

Ideally, every scene contains a turning point. A turning point pivots the
instant the value at stake in the scene dynamically changes from positive to
negative or negative to positive. This change moves the character either
farther from (negative) or closer to (positive) his object of desire than the
previous scene’s turning point. Turning points progress the story along its
spine of action toward the final satisfaction or dissatisfaction of the
protagonist’s desire at story climax.
    A turning point can be created in only one of two ways: by action or
revelation. An event turns either by an immediate, direct action, or by the
disclosure or discovery of a secret or previously unknown fact. Because
dialogue can express both deeds (“I’m leaving for good”) and information
(“I married you for your money”), it can turn a scene’s value charge by
action, revelation, or both at once. If a scene has no turning point, if the
value charge does not change in any kind or degree, then the scene is
merely an exposition-filled nonevent. Too many nonevents in a row and a
story collapses into tedium.9


SCENE PROGRESSION

“Progression” means the continuous topping of previous actions or events.
A scene creates a turning point that progresses the storyline by topping the
turning point in the previous scene. Each sequence of events causes a
moderate change that surpasses the previous in terms of its impact, for
better or worse, on the lives of the characters. Each act climax delivers a
major impact.
   But no matter whether a scene creates a minor, moderate, or major
change in the story, the scene progresses within itself by building beats of
behavior, so that each action/reaction tops the previous beat to and around
the scene’s turning point.10


THE BEAT

Like the physical objects governed by Newton’s third law of motion, every
verbal action causes a reaction. The beat is a unit of scene design that
contains both an action and a reaction from someone or something
somewhere in the setting. Generally, the response comes from another
character, but it could come from within the acting character himself.
    Suppose Character A were to insult Character B. Character B could
react in myriad ways, perhaps with an insult of his own or by laughing at
Character A. Or Character A could react to his own action and apologize.
Or Character A could regret what he said, feel remorse, but say nothing. Or
Character B, who doesn’t speak English, greets the insult with a smile.
These moment-to-moment exchanges of action/reaction build a scene.
Ideally, each beat tops the previous beat and leads to the next. This
continuous surpassing of previous beats within a scene generates dialogue
progression, shaping the scene’s beats to and around its turning point.11
    Beats are best identified by gerunds. A gerund is a noun that names an
action by adding “-ing” to a verb. The four possible beats above, for
example, could be labeled insulting/ridiculing, insulting/apologizing,
insulting/regretting, insulting/greeting. The use of gerunds to name the
actions beneath exchanges of dialogue is the best way I know to stop
yourself from writing on-the-nose.


FIVE STEPS OF BEHAVIOR

When characters use what they say to pursue what they want, the rambling
activity of conversation turns into the focused action of dialogue. Verbal
action, indeed all behavior, moves through five distinct steps from desire to
antagonism to choice to action to expression. Because people often act and
react in a flash, these steps seem fused together because they fly from first
to last in a blur. But that’s life, not writing. No matter how quickly and
instinctively things might happen, the five steps are always there. To make
the flow of character behavior as clear as possible, let’s examine these five
steps in slow-motion detail:
    1. Desire: The moment a character’s life is thrown out of balance
(inciting incident), he, in reaction, conceives of (or at least senses) what he
must achieve in order to restore life’s balance (object of desire). His
overarching purpose to reach the object of desire (super-intention)
motivates his active pursuit (spine of action). As he moves along the story’s
spine, at each specific moment (scene) he must satisfy an immediate want
(scene intention) in order to progress toward his object of desire. The
foreground desire of scene intention and underlying pull of the super-
intention influence each choice of action he makes and takes. But his
background desires limit his choices because they influence what he cannot
or will not do.
    2. Sense of Antagonism: Before the character can act, however, he must
sense or recognize the immediate forces of antagonism that block his way.
How much of his understanding is conscious or subconscious, realistic or
mistaken, depends on the psychology of the character, the nature of his
situation, and the story the author is telling.
    3. Choice of Action: The character then chooses to take a specific action
in an effort to cause a reaction from his world that will move him toward
his scene intention. Again, how deliberate or instantaneous this choice may
be is relative to the nature of the character and his situation.
    4. Action: The activity the character chooses to carry out his action may
be physical or verbal or both. Desire is the source of action, and action is
the source of dialogue.
    5. Expression: To the extent that the character’s action needs words to
carry it out, the writer composes dialogue.
    To create a scene, an author must separate the links in this chain of
behavior and give consideration to each. (How conscious or subconscious
this “consideration” may be varies from writer to writer. Oscar Wilde once
noted that an author spends a whole morning putting in a comma and a
whole afternoon taking it out. But that’s Wilde. For some writers, commas
just get in the way.) Finally, in however long it may take to pen one perfect
speech, the writer pieces the links back together so they happen in the
breath of time it takes an actor to act or a reader to read.
    It is impossible to know exactly what a character will say in this fifth
step until we answer these questions: What does the character want? What
stops him from getting it? What will he choose to do in an effort to achieve
it?
    A scene lives, not in the activity of talking, but in the action the
character takes by talking. So before we write dialogue, we must ask
questions and find answers that guide us down the stream from desire to
antagonism to choice to action, ending in expression—the dialogue that
helps shape and turn the scene.
INTRODUCTION TO SEVEN CASE STUDIES

The five stages of character behavior blend in concert to create a
progressive subtext that ultimately finds expression in dialogue. To
demonstrate how this works, we’ll examine five dramatized scenes—two
from teleplays, one each from a play, a novel, a screenplay—plus two
passages of narratized dialogue in prose. Each author employs a
distinctively different balance, type, and intensity of conflict. The quality of
conflict determines the quality of action, and the quality of action
determines the quality of talk. As a result, the behaviors of characters, the
dynamic of beats, and, above all, the tonality of each scene’s dialogue play
out in seven distinctively different ways over the next six chapters.
    Balanced conflict: In the “Two Tonys” episode from THE
SOPRANOS, series creator David Chase and cowriter Terence Winter turn
their characters loose in a hard-fought duelogue of equals.
    Comic conflict: The “Author, Author” episode from FRASIER, written
by Don Seigel and Jerry Perzigian, exaggerates balanced conflict to its
lunatic limits.
    Asymmetric conflict: In A Raisin in the Sun, playwright Lorraine
Hansberry sets one character’s aggressive verbal action against another’s
quiet resistance.
    Indirect conflict: In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s characters
manipulate each other with words of covert antagonism.
    Reflexive conflict: Chapter Seventeen compares the uses of narratized
dialogue in two novels: In Fräulein Else, Arthur Schnitzler uses this
technique to wage inner conflict within his protagonist, self against self;
whereas in The Museum of Innocence, Orhan Pamuk’s protagonist
confesses his inner wars directly to the reader.
    Implied conflict: In LOST IN TRANSLATION, screenwriter Sofia
Coppola suspends her characters in depths of inner tension, self versus self,
played out in the shadows of conflicts from the past.
    The following chapters demonstrate a working method for scene
analysis that separates a scene into its components, pulls out their
subtextual actions, labels them with gerunds, and then discovers how these
actions express themselves in dialogue. The technique begins with breaking
a scene into its beats.
    Over the decades, writers have evolved three different meanings for the
term “beat.” In the outlining stages of a screenplay, some filmmakers use
the word to name a story’s key turning points: “In the story’s first beat they
meet; in the second beat they fall in love.” Playwrights and screenwriters
often place the term between parentheses in a column of dialogue, e.g.,
(beat), to signal a short pause. But for the purposes of exploring how a
scene’s inner life inspires its dialogue, I use “beat” in its original sense: a
unit of action/reaction. An action starts a beat; a corresponding reaction
ends it.
    When scenes feel lifeless or false, the cause is rarely found in the
language of the dialogue. Rather, flaws fester in the subtext. For that reason,
we break a scene into its beats in order to uncover the misshapen subtextual
actions and reactions that cause these faults. A skillful analysis then guides
the redesign of the scene’s beats and, with that, the re-creation of its
dialogue.
    No matter how many times a pattern of action/reaction repeats, it
constitutes one, and only one, beat. A scene cannot progress unless its beats
change, and beats cannot change until the characters change their tactics.
Indeed, the most common early warning sign of an ailing scene is
repetitious beats—characters using the same tactic to take essentially the
same action, again and again, but using different words, speech after
speech, to do it. These duplicating beats hide beneath a scene’s verbiage,
and it often takes an insightful, beat-by-beat analysis to bring this flaw to
light.
    Before we move on, however, a note of caution: No one can teach you
how to write. I can only define the shape and function of a scene, lay out its
components, and demonstrate their inner workings. Although the principles
of scene design illuminate creativity, they are not the creative process itself.
The following six chapters are logical, after-the-fact analyses of finished
work. My breakdowns do not presume to know the artist’s process or follow
his or her actual writing experience.
    Of this, however, I am certain: Writing rarely flows in a straight line.
Creativity likes to zigzag—trial/error, elation/depression, this way and that,
draft after draft after draft. Knowledge of story and scene design
strengthens the work, provokes ideas, and guides rewrites, but an author
must discover through her personal creative process exactly how to use her
talent and expertise to move from inspiration to last draft.

             BALANCED CONFLICT


THE SOPRANOS

THE SOPRANOS ran on HBO from January 1999 to June 2007. Its eighty-
six episodes tell the story of Tony Soprano, a New Jersey Mafia don,
portrayed by James Gandolfini. David Chase, the series creator, built this
complex, multidimensional character around a core contradiction: On one
hand, Tony commits violent, tyrannical, murderous acts; on the other, he
falls victim to paralyzing nightmares and sudden, unexplained panic
attacks.
    Realizing that his panic disorder could cost him his life, Tony seeks the
help of a psychiatrist, Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco). Over the next
four seasons, their therapy sessions struggle through moral dilemmas,
sexual tensions, and bouts of Tony’s raging temper, until Tony finally
breaks off his therapy.
    In Episode 1 of Season 5, he convinces himself that he’s deeply in love
with Melfi and goes on a romantic quest. He has often flirted with her, but
now he puts on his best courting behavior and asks her out for dinner twice.
Twice she declines, but he persists until he finally confronts her in her
office.
    I will work through their confrontation with an eye to the scene’s four
essential modes: 1) how the five steps of behavior (desire, antagonism,
choice, action, expression) translate into the characters’ scene intentions
and tactics, 2) how their beats of action/reaction shape progression, 3) how
the values at stake arc their changing charges, and 4) how these
foundational layers impel and inspire the scene’s character-specific
dialogue.
    I will take you through this inside-out analysis to remind you once again
that character talk is the final result of everything that went before, a
surface manifestation of the layers of life beneath the words. The stronger
the inner scene, the more powerful the dialogue.
    To begin: If we were to ask Tony what he wants (desire) and what’s
stopping him from getting it (antagonism), he would tell us that he wants to
win Jennifer Melfi’s love, but she resists because she doesn’t see the other
Tony, the nice-guy Tony. Tony’s scene intention is to seduce Melfi, and his
tactic (action) is to prove that he’s a nice guy.
    If we were to ask Dr. Melfi the same questions, she would tell us that
she wants to help Tony overcome his emotional problems (desire), but his
impulse to take their relationship from professional to personal makes that
impossible (antagonism). Melfi’s scene intention is to help Tony change for
the better, and her tactic (action) is to confront him with the truth.
    However, if we look past Tony’s romantic gestures, we sense that the
ruling value of his life is power. His Romeo persona masks his
subconscious lust, not for sex, but for ownership. He needs to dominate the
only person who has ever wielded power over him—Dr. Melfi.
    But Melfi packs double-fisted punches of truth and morality. She knows
the truth of Tony’s immature, sociopathic nature. In the face of her high
moral standards and courage (antagonism), Tony flinches and withers. So
his dark self, hungry to regain the upper hand, silently urges him to get her
into bed and give her the orgasmic thrill of a lifetime. With that, he thinks,
her moral shell will crack and she will fall into his arms, enthralled and
subservient. His subconscious desire (super-intention), therefore, is to
subjugate Melfi.
    Dr. Melfi tells Tony she wants to help him, therapeutically; and
consciously, of course, she means what she says. But if we look beneath her
prudent, professional personality, we sense the very opposite of discretion
and objectivity. We see a high-risk adventurer.
    Consider this: During her university years, Melfi could have taken any
number of career paths, but she chose clinical psychiatry. Now, picture a
psychiatrist’s day.
    Imagine the enormous mental stamina and emotional courage it must
take to burrow into the dark unknown of life-wrecked souls. Think of the
damage done to the therapist as she listens with empathy to the wretched,
tortured, heartbreaking confessions of neurotic after psychotic, hour by
hour, day by day. Almost no one, it seems to me, would devote herself to
that profession unless, deep inside, she found exploring the danger-filled
jungles of other people’s minds fascinating, even exhilarating.
    Dr. Melfi’s core dimension sends her risk-averse characterization up
against her risk-enticed true character. To express her contradictory nature,
the writers propel her through a series-long, dynamic, on-again, off-again
relationship with Tony Soprano.
    Soon after Dr. Melfi takes Tony Soprano as a patient, she discovers he’s
a murderous Mafia don. At first, ending the relationship seems her only
option, but in time she overcomes her disgust and continues treating him.
Her probing questions about his parents often provoke his rage and a break
in therapy. But once time quiets his rage, she always takes Tony back, even
though she knows that someday he may turn his violence against her.
    Near the end of Season 1, Tony tells her that rival mobsters plan to kill
her because they fear he may have revealed Mafia secrets during therapy.
Melfi goes into hiding while Tony hunts down and kills the assassins. Once
the danger lifts, Melfi resumes Tony’s sessions.
    Dr. Melfi’s pattern of on-again, off-again psychotherapy raises this
question: Why would a psychiatrist put her life at risk to treat a manifestly
impulsive, sociopathic criminal? One possible answer:
    While her conscious concern for a secure doctor/patient relationship
masks her true desire, subconsciously she actually wants the very
contradiction of security; she longs for risk, life-and-death risk. Her super-
intention seeks the heart-pounding rush that can only be found along the
fuse burning of danger.
    Three values arc over the course of the scene: together/apart in the
doctor/patient relationship; self-deception/self-awareness in Tony’s mind;
and the core value, jeopardy/security for Dr. Melfi’s life. As the scene
opens, these values begin with the two characters together on speaking
terms (positive), Tony blind to his moral identity (negative), and, most
importantly, Dr. Melfi in life-and-death jeopardy as she confronts her
dangerous patient (negative).
    The scene matches two powerful personalities in a balanced conflict,
told over thirteen beats. The first twelve beats match Tony’s actions against
Dr. Melfi’s reactions, but the last beat reverses that pattern and sends Tony
out the door.
    A transcription of the scene as televised follows, printed in bold. First
read the bold passages straight through, skipping over my analysis. As you
do, listen to the dialogue in your mind, or better yet, act it out aloud and feel
what it would be like emotionally to live through this conflict, first from
Tony’s point of view, and then from Dr. Melfi’s.
    Once you have a sense for how the scene arcs, reread it against my
analysis of the beats, their subtext, and the shaping of the action.

     INT. DR. MELFI’S OFFICE—EARLY EVENING

     As PATIENTS from a group session file out, Tony enters like a lost little boy.



BEAT 1
     Dr. Melfi looks up, surprised to see him.

                                             MELFI
         Anthony.

     As Tony glances down, embarrassed, Dr. Melfi strides up to him.

                                             MELFI
         Hello.

                                                 TONY
                                        (with a shy smile)
         Hi.

ACTION: Tony turning on the charm.
REACTION: Melfi gearing up for trouble.
SUBTEXT: Twice that day Tony asked Dr. Melfi out for dinner, and twice
she turned him down. Tony senses he’s out on a limb, so as he enters, he
plays sensitive and shy, hoping to win her sympathy. Beneath her cheerful
welcome, she puzzles over why he’s back yet again and readies herself for a
third confrontation.

BEAT 2

                                          TONY
                                 (handing her an envelope)
        A friend of mine had these and couldn’t use them. And I figure, well, maybe
        we could.

                                       (explaining)
        Tickets… Bermuda…

                                   (doing a little dance)
        … lodging at the Elbow Beach Hotel.
                                         MELFI
                                         (amazed)
        I turn down a wonderful dinner invitation and you think I’ll go away with
        you?

ACTION: Tony propositioning her.
REACTION: Melfi calling him an idiot.
SUBTEXT: Tony bought the tickets himself. He not only lies about that, but
far worse, his underlying action treats Dr. Melfi like a whore. Dinner for
two might cost $200; a weekend at the five-star Elbow Beach Hotel would
run into the thousands. Tony ups the ante, thinking she turned down his
previous offers because they were too cheap.
    Tony’s disrespect and delusions offend Dr. Melfi, but because she knows
he’s prone to violence, she avoids direct confrontation by repaying his
insult with a rhetorical question. This ancient verbal tactic asks a question
but not to get an answer; it assumes the answer in the question. So if we
were to rewrite Melfi’s dialogue on-the-nose, it might read: “What kind of
man thinks I’ll sleep with him just because he takes me to Bermuda? An
idiot.”

BEAT 3

                                              TONY
          Well, the guy couldn’t use ’em and, you know, he gave ’em to me and what’d
          you want me to do, throw ’em away?

     Dr. Melfi stands in silence.

ACTION: Tony claiming his innocence.
REACTION: Melfi avoiding conflict.
SUBTEXT: Tony tries to shrug off her criticism by pretending his
proposition wasn’t manipulative, just practical—he’s the innocent victim of
a friend’s generosity.
    Dr. Melfi knows he bought the tickets as a sexual bribe, but rather than
call out his canard, she turns silence into a weapon. In the right context,
refusing to speak can be more powerful than anything said.

BEAT 4

                                              TONY
                                           (continuing)
          Come on, Doc. I’m breaking out the big guns here. You’re turning me into half
          a stalker.

                                             MELFI
          Listen, Anthony. I’m not going to go out with you, okay, and it’s not because
          you’re unattractive or I don’t think I would have a good time. It’s just
          something I’m not going to do. I would like you to respect my decision and just
          try to feel that I know what’s right for me. Okay?

     Long pause.

ACTION: Tony playing for pity.
REACTION: Melfi blaming him.
SUBTEXT: By accusing her of demeaning him, he plays the victim again
and adds guilt-tripping to his tactics, all in the hope that she’ll feel sorry for
him.
   Instead, she begins with the “It’s not you, it’s me” tactic, seeming to put
the blame on herself. But the phrase “I know what’s right for me” alerts
Tony. Despite her opening ploy, it implies that he is not right for her
because there’s something wrong, something broken inside him.
   Tony came to her in hopes of getting laid, but when she hints at his
flawed nature, the subconscious need that has driven Tony through the
entire series takes hold. He desperately longs for an answer to the core
question of his life, a question only his psychiatrist can answer: What is
wrong with me?

BEAT 5

                                                TONY
        But it’s not just the psychiatric ethics stuff, is it?

                                               MELFI
        I want to preserve the option for you that you could always come back to our
        work, if you wish, and that we could pick up where we’ve left off.

ACTION: Tony looking for a way out.
REACTION: Melfi giving him a way out.
SUBTEXT: On the conscious level, however, Tony would rather not
confront the truth about himself, so if she had said, “Yes, it’s a matter of
medical ethics,” he would have been relieved and the scene would be over.
Instead, she offers him the hard, painful work of self-awareness through
therapy.

BEAT 6

                                                TONY
        I don’t think you get this. I want you!

                                               MELFI
        That’s very flattering to me.

                                                 TONY
        I’m not interested in flattering you.

                                                 MELFI
        I know you’re not.

ACTION: Tony laying it on the line.
REACTION: Melfi buying time.
SUBTEXT: Tony evades the big question to make a brutal pass, hoping that
the offer of sex for sex’s sake will excite and distract her. It doesn’t, of
course. Instead, she uses non-answer responses to buy time while deciding
just how truthful she dares to be.

BEAT 7

                                                 TONY
        Then, what is it, okay? What is it?
                                             (pause, quieter)
        Just… help me understand it, okay?

                                                 MELFI
        You know, Anthony, during our work I never judged you, or your behavior.
        It’s not the place of a therapist to do so.

                                                 TONY
        All right, I get all this. Go, go.

                                                 MELFI
        In a personal relationship, I don’t think I could sit silent.

ACTION: Tony asking for trouble.
REACTION: Melfi crossing the line.
SUBTEXT: Tony begs for the truth, but Dr. Melfi knows the furious effect
truth can have on him, so she stalls. Still, he insists, so after sidestepping for
six beats, she finally crosses the line from professional to personal, and by
doing so, she puts herself in grave danger.

BEAT 8

                                            TONY
         About what?

                                            MELFI
         Our values are… just very different.

ACTION: Tony cornering her.
REACTION: Melfi belittling him.
SUBTEXT: When he pressures her for an answer, she insults him and hints
for the second time that she knows his hidden weakness.
    Tony can read subtext with the best. When she says that the values
separating them are “just very different,” he knows that that’s PC for “My
values are clearly better than yours, but let’s not fight about it.”
    The word “values” startles Tony, and its insinuations anger him, but he
manages to hold his rage in check.

BEAT 9
                                            TONY
         You don’t like my values?

                                            MELFI
         Honestly?

                                            TONY
         Yeah.

     A tense pause.

                                            MELFI
         No.

ACTION: Tony daring her to cross him.
REACTION: Melfi denying his worth.
SUBTEXT: We measure a person’s worth in the quality of his values and
the actions they motivate. By rejecting Tony’s personal values, she rejects
his value as a person.
    When Tony confronts Dr. Melfi, she does not flinch. Instead, she states
her disdain for him with such sudden, unexpected power that he drops his
bullying tone.

BEAT 10
                                             TONY
        Okay.

                                             (pause)
        Like what?

                                             MELFI
                                     (glancing at her watch)
        It’s getting late.

ACTION: Tony asking nice.
REACTION: Melfi giving him a last way out.
SUBTEXT: Feeling vulnerable and dreading the worst, Tony softens his
tone. Dr. Melfi, knowing that her insights will wound Tony and perhaps
enrage him, offers him an excuse not to know.

BEAT 11

                                             TONY
        No, no, no, no. Come on. It’s okay. It’s okay.

                                             MELFI
        Well… you’re not a truthful person. You’re not respectful of women. You’re
        not really respectful of people.

ACTION: Tony inviting the worst.
REACTION: Melfi pulling her punch.
SUBTEXT: At some level, Tony realizes that the answer to “What is wrong
with me?” will scald his sense of self, but he pursues it to the blistered end.
   Notice that when Dr. Melfi hits Tony with the bitter facts, her language
softens the blow. She could have called him a liar, abuser, or worse. Instead,
she keeps her cool control—“not a truthful person,” “not really respectful.”

BEAT 12
                                             TONY
        I don’t love people?

                                             MELFI
        Maybe you love them, I don’t know. You take what you want from them by
        force, or the threat of force.

ACTION: Tony doubting himself.
REACTION: Melfi firing the first barrel.
SUBTEXT: Tony has never for a moment doubted his love for his family,
friends, and lovers. But the instant Dr. Melfi shows him his essential
tyrannical nature, he cannot argue back. Instead, he phrases his denial as a
question, a question he seems to ask himself as much as her.
    Line by line, fact by fact, Dr. Melfi has destroyed Tony’s self-worth. She
knows full well that, humiliated and emasculated, he might lash out in
violence. She faces a dilemma between speaking the final full truth and the
violence it might bring versus keeping silent and staying secure. She makes
her choice of action and dares to launch the final beat.


BEAT 13
                                             MELFI
                                          (continuing)
        I couldn’t live like that. I couldn’t bear witness to violence or—

                                             TONY
        —Fuck you…
     Tony runs out, slams the door, and shouts from the lobby:

                                            TONY
         … you fucking cunt.

ACTION: Melfi firing the second barrel.
REACTION: Tony killing her with words.
SUBTEXT: In Beat 12 she impugns Tony’s morals, but in Beat 13 she
denigrates the whole gangster life and, with that, everyone close to him.
    He could kill her for those insults; he has killed others for as much. But
he runs out instead because of the way the writers staged the opening. As
Tony entered Dr. Melfi’s office, a dozen members of a group session filed
out past him. She saw Tony standing in the crowd and called out to him. In
other words, there were witnesses. If he were to attack her now, those
people could put him at the scene by name. Tony’s too savvy to make that
mistake, so he fires off the most lethal words he knows.
    This final beat turns with a sharp irony. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that she
cannot witness violence, but we suspect that subconsciously she relishes
face-to-face brushes with violence and the adrenaline rush they bring.
    So even though Tony starts every beat but the last, it’s Dr. Melfi’s
passive aggression that carries the scene to its climax. At first, she deflects
his sexual moves, then in Beat 4 she provokes his desire to know why, and
finally, she leads him to the self-discovery he dreads. On balance, Dr. Melfi
owns the more powerful personality; she controls the conflict from open to
close.


Subtextual Progression

Scan the list of subtextual actions below. Note how they progress the scene:
Conflict builds through the first four beats, backs off for a moment in Beat
5, then progresses to the climax of Beat 13. Next note how this progression
arcs the three values at stake in the scene: 1) Friendship/hatred in the
doctor/patient relationship swings from positive to negative. 2) Tony’s
comfortable self-deception (positive irony) turns to painful self-awareness
(negative irony). 3) Peril/survival for Dr. Melfi pivots from negative to
positive.
    BEAT 1: Turning on the charm/Gearing up for trouble.
    BEAT 2: Propositioning her/Calling him an idiot.
    BEAT 3: Claiming his innocence/Avoiding conflict.
    BEAT 4: Playing for pity/Blaming him.
    BEAT 5: Looking for a way out/Giving him a way out.
    BEAT 6: Laying it on the line/Buying time.
    BEAT 7: Asking for trouble/Crossing the line.
    BEAT 8: Cornering her/Belittling him.
    BEAT 9: Daring her to cross him/Denying his worth.
    BEAT 10: Asking nice/Giving him a last way out.
    BEAT 11: Inviting the worst/Pulling her punch.
    BEAT 12: Doubting himself/Firing her first barrel.
    BEAT 13: Firing her second barrel/Killing her with words.
    To see how inner actions manifest in outer speech, let’s compare the
dialogue for these two characters on three points: content, length, and pace.
    CONTENT: Tony comes into the scene feeling unloved and empty,
suffering from an existential crisis. The reasons he used to give himself for
living his high-risk life no longer make sense. In such a state, people
naturally ask questions, the two biggest being: “Who am I?” and “What’s
the point?”
    Note that half of Tony’s lines are questions. The rest are either lies or
pleas, told and asked in the hope that Dr. Melfi will give him the insight
into himself he craves. The only line in which he does not beg for an
answer is the last, and it may be his weakest, most desperate call for help.
    Dr. Melfi enters the scene at the height of her profession, sated with
confident knowledge. Her therapeutic skill gives her what she wants: the
power to lighten the darkness in her patients’ psyches. As a result, her lines
make statements, the answers to Tony’s questions that she slowly, at times
evasively, doles out.
    LENGTH: As noted in Chapter Seven, when people lose control of their
emotions, their words, phrases, and sentences tend to shorten. Conversely,
people in control often lengthen all three.
    Tony talks in monosyllables, and his longest sentence is ten words; Dr.
Melfi frequently uses three-and four-syllable terms, and her sentences run
as long as twenty-five words. Each of Dr. Melfi’s sentences includes a
noun, verb, and object; Tony often abbreviates meaning into phrases such as
“tickets,” “Bermuda,” “Go, go.”
    PACE: In an athletic event, the player who controls the pace of the game
tends to win. Much the same is true in life. First note how Tony’s staccato
cadence and Dr. Melfi’s languid rhythms mirror their contradictory
emotional states. Then compare Tony’s frantic phrases (“Then, what is it,
okay? What is it?) to Dr. Melfi’s long, slow sentences. Tony tries to
bulldoze through the opening beats, but ultimately, her moral power
controls the pace of the scene. She takes her time; he stumbles from
moment to moment, lurching out in defeat.
    Lastly, Chapter Nine argued that repetitiousness is the enemy of fine
writing, and generally that’s true, but, as always, the antithesis has its uses,
too. Like waves pounding a shore, the writers use repetition to swell Tony’s
rising tide of anger and frustration. He repeats, for example, the word
“okay” five times, the last two as a promise not to hurt her—which, by
climax, if he could, he would (“Fuck you, you fucking cunt”).
    If you haven’t already, watch the scene online to study how the
dialogue’s contrasting qualities of content, length, and pace help channel
the actors’ performances.
    In life, emotions seem to surge from the belly and then spread through
the body. For this reason, acting coaches teach their students to think, not in
their heads, but in their guts. Bad actors tend to be self-puppeteers who
work from the head down to pull their own strings; fine actors let conflict
hit below the waist as they surrender to their character.
    An instinct-driven performance is only possible if the writing, text and
subtext, allows the actor to feel the meaning of the words in his guts, so that
idea and emotion merge into immediate, vivid, seemingly spontaneous
dialogue. Because the writing of THE SOPRANOS was the best of its day,
James Gandolfini could create the from-the-guts tour de force that carried
him to multiple Emmy, Screen Actors Guild, and Golden Globe Awards.

                  COMIC CONFLICT


All characters pursue secondary desires per scene (scene intention) in
pursuit of a primary, overall desire per story (super-intention). If, however,
we were to place all stories ever told along a spectrum ranging from tragedy
to farce, we would see that dramatic characters and comic characters go
about these pursuits with distinctively different dialogue styles.
    The reason is simple: These two basic character types possess two
fundamentally different mentalities. They do not think the same, and so
they do not speak the same. Writing dialogue for one versus the other,
therefore, demands two decidedly different techniques.
    The dramatic character pursues what life demands with some degree of
awareness. He has a mental flexibility that lets him step back from the fray
and think the thought, “Wow, this could get me killed.” This realization
doesn’t necessarily stop his quest, but he’s aware of its irony and risk. Tony
Soprano, for instance, in the midst of rage, has enough mindfulness not to
commit murder in public.
    What makes a comic character comic is mental rigidity. He pursues his
all-absorbing desire as if myopic to any choice beyond it. In the scene I’ll
analyze below, for example, two psychiatrists (e.g., professionals who
ought to know better) are so consumed by sibling rivalry they regress to
infanticide.
    In centuries past, the monomania of the comic character was known as
his “humor.” In 1612, playwright Ben Jonson wrote a verse prologue to his
comedy Every Man out of His Humour. In it, he drew upon theories from
medieval physiology that allege that every person’s body has a unique
balance of four humors (fluids)—blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile
—and their one-of-a-kind concoction determines each person’s specific
temperament. (Why the ancients didn’t add sexual fluids to their list of
humors, I cannot say, but they sure seem influential to me.)
    Jonson seized upon this theory as a metaphor for the comic character. In
his definition, a humor arises

      … when some one peculiar quality
      Doth so possesse a man, that it doth draw
      All his affects, his spirits, and his powers
      In their confluctions, all to runne one way.1

    In my comedy lectures, I call Jonson’s “one peculiar quality” the blind
obsession. As noted in Chapter Eleven, desire intensifies in the comic
character to the point of obsession. This fixation holds the character so
tightly in its grip he cannot deviate from it. All aspects of his identity are
bound to it; without it, he is no longer comic. What’s more, this obsession
blinds him. He is driven to pursue it but cannot see the mania in himself. To
us, he’s a crazed neurotic; to him, his obsession is normalcy.
    Consider, for example, Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers and
others), the protagonist of no less than eleven Pink Panther films. Deaf,
dumb, and blind to his incompetence, Clouseau obsesses on perfection. He
devotes every compulsive waking hour to becoming the world’s ultimate
detective.
    A few comic protagonists, such as Woody Allen’s Alvy Singer in
ANNIE HALL and Larry David’s Larry David in CURB YOUR
ENTHUSIASM, constantly dissect their obsession, phobically alert to any
sign of neuroses. But what they do not grasp is that addictive self-analysis
is itself a blind obsession. The more seriously and persistently these two
guys self-psychoanalyze, the more hysterical they become—in both senses
of the word.
    The comic protagonist’s blind obsession usually comes nested inside
otherwise normal traits that anoint him with believability, dimensionalize
his personality, and make him one of a kind. The art of comedy, however,
imposes certain limitations on dimensionality, for this reason: Jokes require
objectivity. Laughter explodes the moment two incongruous ideas suddenly
clash in the mind. If their illogicality is not instantly recognized, the gag
sputters in confusion. Therefore, the mind of the reader/audience must be
kept sharply focused and uncluttered by compassion.
    In Chapter Eleven’s 30 ROCK case study, I defined a dimension as a
consistent contradiction within a character’s nature: either a contradiction
between an outer trait of characterization versus an inner quality of true
character (e.g., Jack Foley’s romantic charm versus his bank robber’s ethics
in Out of Sight), or a deep contradiction within the inner self (e.g.,
Macbeth’s blood-soaked ambition to be king versus his guilt-ridden
conscience over the actions he takes to be king).
    A profound self-contradiction (such as those we saw previously within
Dr. Melfi and Tony Soprano) draws a reader/audience into an empathic
identification with a fellow human being and a compassionate concern for
that character’s well-being. We welcome feelings in drama, but in comedy,
empathy and compassion kill the laughs.
    For this reason, comic protagonists, almost without exception, have
fewer dimensions than their dramatic counterparts and virtually none at the
subconscious level of conflicted inner selves. Instead, comic dimensions pit
appearance against reality, the man the character thinks he is versus the fool
we know him in fact to be.
    Bit parts in comedy—geek, diva, jock, valley girl, fop, braggart, nag,
nerd, etc.—chase their blind obsession with glaring clarity because
monomania is their only trait. As you might imagine, writing fresh,
innovative dialogue for these nondimensional roles can break your brain.
Indeed, many comedies fail at this. Too often, when supporting characters
speak, their blind obsession funnels what they say into trite lingo and
clichéd reactions.


FRASIER
Peter Casey, David Lee, and David Angell spun FRASIER off from the
sitcom CHEERS and filled it with a cast of unique obsessives. The show
ran on NBC from 1993 to 2004, winning a record thirty-seven Emmy
Awards. It tells the story of radio talk show psychiatrist Frasier Crane
(Kelsey Grammer), his brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce), and the people
in their lives.
    Frasier and Niles share a number of blind obsessions. These become
super-intentions that weave in and out of storylines, arcing through 264
episodes in eleven seasons, unifying the series: Both Frasier and Niles have
a mortal fear of embarrassment; both crave social, intellectual, and cultural
status—all leading to their supreme, often snobbish, pretentiousness; and,
like all self-respecting comic characters, they obsess on sex.
    In a first season episode entitled “Author, Author,” Frasier and Niles
have contracted with a publisher to write a book on the psychology of
sibling rivalry. As fellow psychiatrists and siblings, this book, they feel,
should be a snap. Unfortunately, they procrastinate the actual writing to the
last day before the contract’s deadline.
    Desperate, they isolate themselves in a hotel room where they manage,
after great difficulty, to compose a lead sentence. But then the fear of
embarrassment grabs them by the throat: “What will people say if we fail as
writers?” This fear paralyzes them with writer’s block, and they spend the
rest of the day and the whole of the night eating and drinking their way
through the minibar, writing nothing.
    The opening four beats turn on the value of humiliation/pride, but that
dread quickly segues into yet another grand, series-long obsession: their
mutual envy and constant competition, a.k.a. sibling rivalry, the very
subject of the book they struggle to write. Onscreen, the scene runs for three
minutes and fourteen seconds, igniting direct conflict between Frasier and
Niles, two equally imbalanced personalities.
    As in the previous chapter, I will work with the scene from two angles:
Viewing it from the outside in, I will look at the beats of action/reaction that
shape the scene’s progression as well as the changing charge of its values.
Reversing the angle to the inside out, I will trace the steps of behavior—
desire, antagonism, choice, action—that translate the intentions and tactics
of Frasier and Niles into comically expressive dialogue.
    Once again, the scene is printed in bold. Read it through without break
and then review it in light of my notes.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM—EARLY MORNING

     As Niles nods off in front of the computer keyboard, Frasier pulls open the drapes.



BEAT 1

                                             FRASIER
                                      (looking out at the day)
         Oh, dear God! It’s dawn! It’s Friday!
                                      (turning to his brother)
         Niles, why don’t we just admit it? We can’t work together. There’s never going
         to be any book.


                                               NILES
         No, not with that attitude, there isn’t.


ACTION: Frasier urging Niles to accept failure.
REACTION: Niles blaming their failure on Frasier.
SUBTEXT: Niles and Frasier begin with the same scene intention: the
desire to fix blame. To Frasier’s credit, he’s willing to share blame, but
Niles, to preserve his pride, places the fault squarely on his brother. They
instantly become each other’s antagonist, and for the next four beats choose
name-calling as their underlying tactic. At first, their spiraling insults
masquerade as accusations, but by Beat 6 the masks fall.
TECHNIQUE: Comedy writing calls for artful exaggeration. Over-the-top
distortion itself often prompts laughs, but its primary work is to promote
enough distance between the characters and the reader/audience that we can
judge behaviors against what society considers normal and find them
ridiculously out of step.
    Note Frasier’s first line: He could have simply said, “It’s morning.”
Instead, he calls upon the deity. Comic dialogue thrives on overstatement
(although understatement is also an exaggeration).
BEAT 2

                                           FRASIER
        Will you get off it? Come on. The fat lady has sung. The curtain has been rung
        down. Let’s just go home.


                                            NILES
        Well, I guess I shouldn’t be surprised you’d give up so easily. It’s not your
        dream after all. Why should it be, mister big shot radio host.


ACTION: Frasier calling Niles an idiot.
REACTION: Niles calling Frasier a snob.
SUBTEXT: Frasier accuses Niles of being oblivious to the obvious. We
have a name for those people: idiots. Niles, in turn, accuses Frasier of being
arrogantly self-important and looking down on lesser souls. We have a
name for those people: snobs. Their accusations become humiliations with a
literary touch.
    Both Niles and Frasier are culture vultures, so notice that when Frasier
declares that their work is done, he references opera and theatre.

BEAT 3

                                           FRASIER
        Is that what this little tantrum is all about, huh? You’re jealous of my
        celebrity?


                                            NILES
        It’s not a tantrum and I’m not jealous. I’m just FED UP! I’m fed up with
        being second all the time. You know, I wanted to be a psychiatrist, just like
        mom, way before you did, but because you were older, you got there first. You
        were first to get married; you were first to give Dad the grandchild he always
        wanted. By the time I get around to doing anything, it’s all chewed meat.


ACTION: Frasier calling Niles a petulant child.
REACTION: Niles calling Frasier an upstaging ham.
SUBTEXT: Frasier’s accusation is on point. Niles lapses into an adolescent
snit as he accuses Frasier of deliberately hogging life’s spotlight and thus
ruining his dreams. To save his pride Niles conflates coincidence with
malevolence—a massive exaggeration.
TECHNIQUE: Note the phrase “chewed meat.” Its incongruity pops a
smart laugh, but more to the point, the allusion fits hand and glove with the
rest of the scene. Mothers around the world pre-chew meat so their infants
can swallow it. The whole scene plays as an elaborate Benjamin Button–
like metaphor, regressing the brothers to their diapered days, so that at
climax Frasier can reenact his failed infanticide of Niles.

BEAT 4

                                           FRASIER
        You’re crying about something we can’t change.


                                            NILES
        You wouldn’t change it if you could. You love it.


ACTION: Frasier calling Niles a masochist.
REACTION: Niles calling Frasier a sadist.
SUBTEXT: Frasier accuses Niles of crying for no reason. We have a name
for people who indulge needless suffering: masochists. Niles, in turn,
accuses Frasier of reveling in his misery. We have a name for people who
enjoy watching others suffer: sadists. These brothers are psychiatrists; they
punch the secret places below the belt.
TECHNIQUE: A joke is a design in two parts: setup/payoff. The setup
arouses energy; the payoff explodes it into laughter. Comic energy comes
from three primary sources: defensive emotions, aggressive emotions, and
sex. For this reason, when we look deeply into comic subtext, things can get
scary, angry, and wild. But then, the more powerful the setup, the bigger the
laugh.
   You may or may not agree with the darkness of my interpretation, but
when we reach the climax, look back and ask if it doesn’t fit.
BEAT 5

                                              FRASIER
        Oh, let it go, Niles.


                                                NILES
        I can’t let it go. My nose is rubbed in it every day. I’M the one on the board of
        the Psychiatric Association; MY research is well respected in academic circles;
        four of MY patients have been elected to political office, but it’s YOUR big fat
        face they put on the side of buses.


ACTION: Frasier calling Niles a crybaby.
REACTION: Niles calling Frasier a show-off.
TECHNIQUE: Note how the writers build the joke in Beat 5. They use a
technique known as trivializing the exalted.
    Niles’s anger over injustice infuses his setup, but he contains the energy
inside a list of institutions of respect: “Psychiatric Association,” “academic
circles,” and “political office.” Then his punch line throws a bomb of
banality: “big fat face they put on the side of buses.”
SUBTEXT: Niles immediately senses that Frasier actually takes pride in his
public transportation portrait. With that, he suffers his final humiliation. The
value of humiliation/pride has run its course, and now a deeper value rooted
in sibling rivalry comes to the fore: winning/losing.

BEAT 6

                                              FRASIER
                                              (indignant)
        I do not have a fat face.


                                                NILES
        Oh, please, I keep wondering how long you’re going to store those nuts for
        winter.
ACTION: Frasier defending his face.
REACTION: Niles attacking his face.
SUBTEXT: By Beat 6 their subtext has risen to the text, and so the beats
that follow are all more or less on-the-nose.

BEAT 7

                                         FRASIER
       Well, at least I’m not spindly.


                                           NILES
       Who are you calling spindly, fat face?


                                         FRASIER
       You, spindly!


                                           NILES
       Fat face!


                                         FRASIER
       Spindly!


                                           NILES
       Fat face!


                                         FRASIER
       Spindly!


                                           NILES
       Fat face!


ACTION: Frasier calling Niles ugly.
REACTION: Niles calling Frasier ugly.
TECHNIQUE: “Spindly,” a unique vocabulary choice, characterizes Frasier
perfectly. Nonetheless, he loses the name-calling contest because he is in
fact more fat-faced than Niles is spindly. Back to the wall, he escalates from
verbal to physical.

BEAT 8

                                     FRASIER
        You take that back!


                                      NILES
        You make me!


ACTION: Frasier making a fist.
REACTION: Niles making a fist.
SUBTEXT: By “making a fist,” I mean they take a moment to mentally and
emotionally prepare for a fight.

BEAT 9

                                     FRASIER
        I will make you.


                                      NILES
        I don’t see you making me.


ACTION: Frasier deciding where to punch.
REACTION: Niles daring him to punch.
SUBTEXT: Under this brief beat, the brothers make decisions about how
far to take the fight. Frasier chooses to start light.

BEAT 10

                                     FRASIER
        Oh yeah, well…
                             (ripping hairs out of his brother’s chest)
        … here’s making you.


    Niles winces in pain.

ACTION: Frasier attacking Niles.
REACTION: Niles gathering his counterattack.
SUBTEXT: Under his wince and yelp, Niles chooses all-out war.
TECHNIQUE: After all of their threatening bluster, pulling out chest hairs
makes a superb comic understatement. Note how the repetition of
make/make/making/making gives the actors staccato, pace-building rhythm.

BEAT 11

    Frasier turns to leave, but Niles races across the room, jumps on Frasier’s back, and
    wrestles him into a violent headlock.


                                             FRASIER
                                             (shouting)
        Ow! Ow! Niles, stop it! We’re psychiatrists, not pugilists!


ACTION: Niles attacking Frasier.
REACTION: Frasier deceiving Niles.
SUBTEXT: Frasier could have used simpler language: “We’re doctors, not
fighters.” Instead, to dupe Niles with vanity, he names their prestigious
medical specialty and the Latinate for “boxer.” The trick works.


BEAT 12
    Niles lets Frasier go.


                                             FRASIER
        I can’t believe you fell for that.
    Frasier spins around and clamps Niles into a fierce headlock.

ACTION: Niles surrendering to Frasier.
REACTION: Frasier attacking Niles.
SUBTEXT: As they regress to childhood, Frasier’s ploy suggests that they
have pulled these tricks on each other many times.

BEAT 13

    Frasier throws Niles on the bed, jumps on top on him, grabs him by the throat, and
    starts strangling him.


                                            NILES
        My God, my God, I’m having a flashback. You’re climbing in my crib and
        jumping on me.


ACTION: Frasier going for the kill.
REACTION: Niles recoiling in terror.
SUBTEXT: Their roughhouse releases a wild, archaic instinct in Frasier.
  Niles, in terror, flashes back to his babyhood and remembers the day
when Frasier actually tried to kill him.

BEAT 14

                                          FRASIER
                             (roaring as he throttles his brother)
        You stole my mommy!!


    Shocked by his murderous actions, Frasier jumps off the bed and rushes out the
    door.

ACTION: Frasier strangling his brother.
REACTION: Frasier fleeing the scene of the crime.
SUBTEXT: This hugely exaggerated beat explodes laughter because it
draws energy from a primal impulse. The Cain and Abel story is a
foundational archetype in Western culture. Sibling rivalry leads to violence
more often than we like to believe. Ask any parent. In a drama, this last beat
would be tragic. But comedy bundles catastrophe in laughter. “You stole my
mommy!”, delivered with Kelsey Grammer’s frenzy, takes the beat
delightfully over the top.

Subtextual Progression
This scene doesn’t arc so much as it drills down. Scan the following list of
subtextual actions to sense the spiral.
    BEAT 1: Urging Niles to accept failure/Blaming their failure on Frasier.
    BEAT 2: Calling Niles an idiot/Calling Frasier a snob.
    BEAT 3: Calling Niles a petulant child/Calling Frasier an upstaging
ham.
    BEAT 4: Calling Niles a masochist/Calling Frasier a sadist.
    BEAT 5: Calling Niles a crybaby/Calling Frasier a show-off.
    BEAT 6: Defending his face/Attacking Frasier’s face.
    BEAT 7: Calling Niles ugly/Calling Frasier ugly.
    BEAT 8: Making a fist/Making a fist.
    BEAT 9: Deciding where to punch/Daring him to punch.
    BEAT 10: Attacking Niles/Gathering his counterattack.
    BEAT 11: Attacking Frasier/Deceiving Niles.
    BEAT 12: Surrendering to Frasier/Attacking Niles.
    BEAT 13: Going for the kill/Recoiling in terror.
    BEAT 14: Strangling his brother/Fleeing the scene of the crime.
    The brothers begin by attacking each other’s personalities, then descend
into sneering at each other’s physical defects, followed by emotional
assaults, bottoming out with near-lethal violence: fourteen beats of fraternal
ferocity made hysterically funny.


COMEDY DIALOGUE TECHNIQUE

Laughter inspired by brutality is made possible by an eons-old convention.
Since the dawn of storytelling, artists have maintained a bright line between
drama and comedy by controlling the audience’s perception of pain: In true
drama, everybody gets hurt; in true comedy, nobody gets hurt. Not really.
    Comic characters may writhe, scream, bounce off walls, and tear their
hair out, but they do it with a wild spirit that allows readers and audiences
to sit back, laugh, and safely feel that it doesn’t really hurt. For without a
clear comic style, readers and audiences would naturally feel sorry for
suffering characters. To the comic writer, empathy spells death. Compassion
kills laughs. Therefore, comic technique must keep the reader/audience
cool, critical, unempathetic—on the safe side of pain.
    Here’s a short list of four techniques designed to keep emotional
distance and trigger laughs.
    1) Clarity: Not only does empathy kill laughs, but so does ambiguity,
perplexity, and all forms of confusion. To keep the laughs rolling,
everything must be clear, starting in the subtext. If a character is up to no
good, the audience or reader may not know exactly what that no good is,
but it should be crystal that what he’s up to is no good.
    Language, too. Piles of blurry, verbose dialogue suffocate laughter. If
you wish to write comedy, go back and review the principles of style
covered in Chapters Five, Six, and Seven. Their every point applies
absolutely to comedy writing. Focus in particular on the fundamentals of
economy and clarity. The best jokes always use the fewest and clearest
possible words.
    2) Exaggeration: Comic dialogue thrives in the gap between cause and
effect. The two most common techniques of exaggeration either bloat a
minor cause into a major overstatement—“You stole my mommy!”—or
shrink a major cause into a minor understatement—“The Harry Potter
Theme Park is a hit with both anglophiles and pedophiles.” Comic
exaggerations come in a variety of modes: dialects, non sequiturs,
malapropisms, impersonations, pretense, sarcasm—all the way down the
line to babble and nonsense.
    3) Timing: As I noted above, jokes pivot around a two-part design:
setup and payoff, a.k.a. punch. The setup arouses aggressive, defensive,
and/or sexual emotions in the reader/audience; the punch explodes that
energy into laughter. The punch, therefore, must arrive at the exact moment
the setup’s emotional charge peaks. Too soon and you get a weak laugh; too
late and you get a groan. Moreover, nothing must follow the punch that
would stifle the laughter.
    These two examples from 30 ROCK:
    “Avery is the most perfect woman ever created. Like a young Bo Derek
stuffed with a Barry Goldwater.” Avery (Elizabeth Banks) and Bo Derek
inspire sexual energy (setup); the antithesis of sex, Barry Goldwater, a
right-wing politician from the sixties, explodes it (punch).
    “If I give in, I’m no longer the alpha in my house. Before you know it,
she’ll have me wearing jeans and reading fiction.” Here the energy of
aggressive masculine dominance (setup) is undercut by a feminine act
(from Jack’s POV), “reading fiction” (punch).
    Note that both jokes use periodic sentences. Their punch words end the
gag and nothing immediately follows, giving the audience room to laugh
before the next beat takes their attention. As the old vaudeville saying goes:
Don’t step on your own laughs.
    In the FRASIER scene, notice that periodic sentences deliver all the
punch words and phrases: “mister big shot radio host,” “chewed meat,” “the
side of buses,” “fat face,” “spindly,” “pugilists,” and “my mommy.”
    The only line that sets its punch word back from the last is Niles’s in
Beat 6: “Oh, please, I keep wondering how long you’re going to store those
nuts for winter.” The punch word is “nuts.” I suspect that the phrasing “Oh,
please, winter’s coming and I keep wondering how long you’re going to
store those nuts” would have gotten a bigger laugh, but I couldn’t be certain
until I could see the actor deliver the line.
    4) Incongruity: To build a joke, the relationship between setup and
punch must strike a spark of incongruity; two things that don’t belong
together suddenly collide. The underlying incongruity in the FRASIER
scene pits civilized adults against their feral childhood selves. Psychiatrists
who should be able to see their obsessions do not, and so cannot control
them. In fact, they do the opposite; they let them loose. The steps they take
to achieve their desires become the very things they must do to make sure
they never achieve them. As a result, they act out the very book they cannot
write.

          ASYMMETRIC CONFLICT


A RAISIN IN THE SUN

Lorraine Hansberry’s play opened in New York on March 11, 1959, starring
Sidney Poitier, Claudia McNeil, Ruby Dee, and Louis Gossett Jr. It was the
first play written by a black woman to reach Broadway and won the New
York Drama Critics’ Circle Award. Two years later Hansberry adapted it to
the screen.
    The play tells the story of a black family living in a tiny apartment on
Chicago’s South Side in the 1950s. The Youngers recently buried the family
patriarch, Walter, who literally worked himself to death. Walter left his
wife, Lena, ten thousand dollars in life insurance. Lena wants to use a third
of the money for a down payment on a house; a third to help her daughter,
Bennie, through medical school; and the rest for her son, Walter Lee.
    Walter Lee and two of his buddies have a plan to open a liquor store, but
they need cash. Walter’s scene intention drives the scene below: to persuade
his wife, Ruth, to help him get the whole ten thousand dollars. Ruth doesn’t
trust her husband’s business venture and knows Lena will never give him
all her money for any purpose, let alone a liquor store. Her scene intention
contradicts his: to evade Walter’s scheme.
    As husband and wife block each other’s conscious desires (force of
antagonism), the scene shapes an asymmetrical conflict. Walter compels the
action and the turning points happen to him. Ruth does her best to avoid
conflict.
    That’s the surface conflict, but taking the scene deeper, what do these
characters really want? Walter Lee is a chauffeur, a dead-end job if there
ever was one. The liquor store, he feels, will give him money and with that
will come pride, independence, and the admiration of his wife and their son,
Travis. Walter Lee wants: to gain self-respect (super-intention).
    What Walter Lee does not know, however, is that his wife is two months
pregnant with a second child. Because they live in poverty, she secretly
contemplates an abortion. Like her husband, she also works for rich white
people, as a domestic. She dreams of a decent life with a regular income in
a home of their own. Ruth desperately needs: to find security (super-
intention).
    Once again, the scene is printed in bold, interspaced with my notes on its
beats and writing techniques. First read the bold passages straight through
as Hansberry wrote the scene. Listen to the language in your mind, or better
yet, read it aloud to yourself. Note the vocabulary with its short, punchy
words; note the stripped-down grammar, and in particular, note the cadence
of Hansberry’s language and how the rhythm of her phrasings matches the
rhythms of her characters’ emotions. Once you have a feeling for how the
scene plays, reread it against my analysis.


A RAISIN IN THE SUN

                                     Act 1, Scene 1

     The Younger apartment kitchen. As Ruth makes breakfast, her husband, Walter
     Lee, enters.

It’s useful, I believe, to think of scenes as mini-dramas, often triggered by a
mini–inciting incident of their own. In this case, Walter throws the morning
out of balance by bringing up his liquor store plans. He knows Ruth scorns
the idea, so as she makes breakfast in a sour mood, he opens the scene with
a smile.
      WALTER: You know what I was thinking ‘bout in the bathroom this morning?

      RUTH: (She looks at him in disgust and turns back to her work) No.



BEAT 1
ACTION: Walter inviting her to talk.
REACTION: Ruth snubbing his offer.
  Notice that as the scene below builds, Hansberry never repeats a beat.

      WALTER: How come you always try to be so pleasant!

      RUTH: What is there to be pleasant ‘bout!



BEAT 2
ACTION: Walter calling her a killjoy.
REACTION: Ruth calling their life a misery.

      WALTER: You want to know what I was thinking ‘bout in the bathroom or not?

      RUTH: I know what you thinking ‘bout.



BEAT 3
ACTION: Walter insisting she listen.
REACTION: Ruth dismissing his idea.
    In the first three beats, Hansberry quickly establishes that after years of
struggle to make ends meet, they’re experts in hurting each other.

      WALTER: (Ignoring her) ‘Bout what me and Willy Harris was talking about last
      night.

      RUTH: (Immediately—a refrain) Willy Harris is a good-for-nothing loudmouth.



BEAT 4
ACTION: Walter ignoring her.
REACTION: Ruth ridiculing him.

     WALTER: Anybody who talks to me has to be a good-for-nothing loudmouth, ain’t
     he? And what you know about who is just a good-for-nothing loudmouth? Charlie
     Atkins was just a “good-for-nothing loudmouth” too, wasn’t he! When he wanted
     me to go in the dry-cleaning business with him. And now—he’s grossing a hundred
     thousand dollars a year. A hundred thousand dollars a year! You still call him a
     loudmouth!

     RUTH: (Bitterly) Oh, Walter Lee… (She sits at the table and drops her head on her
     folded arms)



BEAT 5
ACTION: Walter blaming her.
REACTION: Ruth hiding her guilt.
    Note Hansberry’s skill: This is a superb example of how to set up a
future payoff. At this point neither the audience nor any other character
knows that Ruth is pregnant and contemplating an abortion. As the scene
plays, the audience’s first impression may be that there’s some truth in
Walter’s complaint, that Ruth’s pessimism is a drag on his life. But that’s
Hansberry’s deft setup for a forthcoming payoff. When Ruth’s pregnancy is
revealed, we’ll suddenly grasp the real reason she’s in a tetchy, sullen
mood. We’ll see her character, this scene, and its subtext with a rush of
deep, unexpected but retrospectively logical perception.
    Therefore, the actor playing Ruth must create the pain and dread of her
secret without giving it away and spoiling the audience’s discovery when
the Act 1 climax pays off this scene’s setup.
    For example, Hansberry calls for Ruth to drop her head on her arms at
the table. It looks like frustration over Walter’s badgering, but it could
actually be that she’s suppressing morning sickness. The actor might play
this secretly to herself, but she wouldn’t, for instance, clutch her stomach
and tip off the audience.

     WALTER: (Rising and standing over her) You tired, ain’t you? Tired of everything.
     Me, the boy, the way we live—this beat-up hole, everything. Ain’t you? (She doesn’t
     look up, doesn’t answer) So tired—moaning and groaning all the time, but you
     wouldn’t do nothing to help, would you? You couldn’t be on my side that long for
     nothing, could you?

     RUTH: Walter, please leave me alone.

     WALTER: A man needs for a woman to back him up…

     RUTH: Walter…



BEAT 6
ACTION: Walter calling her selfish.
REACTION: Ruth giving in.
   Ruth submits to listen, or at least pretends to listen. It’s easier than
battling the relentless Walter. He sees it as a sign he’s getting somewhere,
so he changes his manner to sweet talk.

     WALTER: Mama would listen to you. You know she listen to you more than she do
     me and Bennie. She think more of you. All you have to do is just sit down with her
     when you drinking your coffee one morning and talking ’bout things like you do
     and—(He sits down beside her and demonstrates graphically what he thinks her
     methods and tone should be)—you just sip your coffee, see, and say easy like that
     you been thinking ‘bout that deal Walter Lee is so interested in, ‘bout the store and
     all, and sip some more coffee, like what you saying ain’t really that important to you
     —and the next thing you know, she be listening good and asking you questions and
     when I come home—I can tell her the details. This ain’t no fly-by-night proposition,
     baby. I mean we figured it out, me and Willy and Bobo.

     RUTH: (With a frown) Bobo?



BEAT 7
ACTION: Walter seducing her.
REACTION: Ruth smelling a rat.
  It doesn’t occur to Walter that the coffee klatch scene he acts out
ridicules women. In fact, the audience wouldn’t have noticed and might
even have found it amusing because in 1959, offhanded sexism was
commonplace and virtually invisible. But not to Hansberry. This is another
of her excellent setups. She’s planting Walter’s sexism here so she can
harvest it at the end of the scene when he attacks all black women for their
alleged betrayal of black men.

     WALTER: Yeah. You see, this little liquor store we got in mind cost seventy-five
     thousand and we figured the initial investment on the place be ‘bout thirty
     thousand, see. That be ten thousand each. Course, there’s a couple of hundred you
     got to pay so’s you don’t spend you life just waiting for them clowns to let your
     license get approved—

     RUTH: You mean graft?



BEAT 8
ACTION: Walter playing the businessman.
REACTION: Ruth foreseeing disaster.

     WALTER: (Frowning impatiently) Don’t call it that. See there, that just goes to
     show you what women understand about the world. Baby, don’t nothing happen for
     you in this world ‘less you pay somebody off!

     RUTH: Walter, leave me alone!



BEAT 9
ACTION: Walter proving his worldliness.
REACTION: Ruth rejecting his folly.
    Ruth is a deeply moral woman. The thought of an abortion, which was a
felony in the 1950s, eats at her. She must be desperate to talk about it, but
note how Hansberry wisely keeps it in the subtext.

     RUTH: (She raises her head, stares at him vigorously, then says quietly) Eat your
     eggs, they gonna be cold.
     WALTER: (Straightening up from her and looking off) That’s it. There you are.
     Man say to his woman: I got me a dream. His woman say: Eat your eggs. (Sadly,
     but gaining in power) Man say: I got to take hold of this here world, baby! And a
     woman say: Eat your eggs and go to work. (Passionately now) Man say: I got to
     change my life, I’m choking to death, baby. And his woman say—(In utter anguish
     as he brings his fists down on his thighs)—your eggs is getting cold!



BEAT 10
ACTION: Ruth placating him.
REACTION: Walter accusing her of disloyalty.

     RUTH: (Softly) Walter, that ain’t none of our money.

     Walter falls silent and turns away from her.



BEAT 11
ACTION: Ruth swinging a moral hammer.
REACTION: Walter coping with defeat.
FIRST TURNING POINT: This scene plays in not one but two movements.
The first movement begins at the positive as Walter has hope that he can
convince Ruth to help him get his mother’s money. He runs a guilt-tripping
argument, claiming that because Ruth ruined his prior chance at business
success, she owes him her help now. What’s more, as his wife, she is
morally obligated to support her husband’s venture. Of course he
undermines his “moral” position with his willingness to pay bribes. Ruth
finally explodes his argument by pointing out that they have no right to the
money. His dead father earned that money with decades of sweat and pain.
It’s Lena’s money, not theirs. It would be immoral to seduce her out of it.
Beat 11 creates a negative turning point that shatters Walter’s scene
intention. He knows he cannot argue against that truth, so he goes silent for
a moment to gather himself for an attack in a new direction with a new
scene intention: to escape his overwhelming sense of failure.
     WALTER: (Not listening at all or even looking at her) This morning, I was lookin’
     in the mirror and thinking about it. I’m thirty-five years old; I been married eleven
     years and I got a boy who sleeps in the living room—(very, very quietly)—and all I
     got to give him is stories about how rich white people live…

     RUTH: Eat your eggs, Walter.

     WALTER: Damn my eggs… damn all the eggs that ever was!

     RUTH: Then go to work.



BEAT 12
ACTION: Walter begging for sympathy.
REACTION: Ruth ignoring his plea.

     WALTER: (Looking up at her) See—I’m trying to talk to you ’bout myself—
     (shaking his head with the repetition)—and all you can say is eat them eggs and go
     to work.

     RUTH: (Wearily) Honey, you never say nothing new. I listen to you every day, every
     night and every morning, and you never say nothing new. (Shrugging) So you would
     rather be Mr. Arnold than be his chauffeur. So—I would rather be living in
     Buckingham Palace.



BEAT 13
ACTION: Walter accusing her of not loving him.
REACTION: Ruth accusing him of living in a fantasy.

     WALTER: That is just what is wrong with the colored woman in this world… don’t
     understand about building their men up and making ’em feel like they somebody.
     Like they can do something.

     RUTH: (dryly, but to hurt) There are colored men who do things.
BEAT 14
ACTION: Walter blaming her for his failure.
REACTION: Ruth blaming him for his failure.
SECOND TURNING POINT: After his self-pity and guilt trips fall on deaf
ears, Walter tries this logic: All black women make all black men failures.
Ruth is black. Therefore, she’s to blame for his failure. But again she
destroys his argument, this time with a fact and its implication: Some black
men succeed. He is responsible for his failed life. She’s right and he knows
it. Her bitter truth turns the scene to a double negative.

     WALTER: No thanks to the colored woman.

     RUTH: Well, being a colored woman, I guess I can’t help myself none.



BEAT 15
ACTION: Walter clinging to his lame excuse.
REACTION: Ruth sneering at his self-deception.

     WALTER: (Mumbling) We one group of men tied to a race of women with small
     minds.

     Ruth looks away in silence.



BEAT 16
ACTION: Walter soothing his wounded ego.
REACTION: Ruth retreating into her fears.
   Let’s look at Hansberry’s sequence of beats and how she designed their
progression. She starts with a mini–inciting incident: Walter’s cheerful
invitation to talk, followed by Ruth’s hostile, one-word answer, “No.” From
Beat 1 to Beat 6, Hansberry builds the beats to the negative. Each exchange
tops the previous beat as Ruth and Walter add pain on pain, humiliation on
humiliation, putting their love and hope in greater and greater jeopardy.
   BEAT 1: Inviting her to talk/Refusing his invitation.
    BEAT 2: Calling her a killjoy/Calling their life a misery.
    BEAT 3: Insisting she listen/Dismissing his idea.
    BEAT 4: Ignoring her/Ridiculing his idea.
    BEAT 5: Blaming her/Hiding her guilt.
    BEAT 6: Calling her selfish/Giving in.
    Ruth surrenders for a moment to listen to what he has to say.
    As Walter acts out the “coffee klatch” in Beat 7, the scene takes on a
lighter, almost amusing tone. The mood rises toward the positive, and we
begin to feel that Ruth might take his side. But when he mentions Bobo, she
reacts with suspicion, and the scene swings back toward a deeper negative,
building to the turning point at Beat 11.
    BEAT 7: Seducing her/Smelling a rat.
    BEAT 8: Playing the businessman/Foreseeing disaster.
    BEAT 9: Proving his worldliness/Rejecting his folly.
    BEAT 10: Placating him/Accusing her of disloyalty.
    BEAT 11: Swinging a moral hammer/Coping with defeat.
    Beat 11 climaxes Walter’s scene intention. He realizes that Ruth will
never help him get his mother’s money. Walter has failed again. This blow
silences him for a moment, and the scene takes a breath while Walter
gathers his anger and unleashes the scene’s second movement.
    First he must somehow bandage his wounded ego. So in Beat 12 he tries
pleading for Ruth’s understanding, but then in Beats 13 and 14 he turns on
her to blame her and all black women for his failure. Finally she nails him
with the truth.
    BEAT 12: Begging for sympathy/Ignoring his plea.
    BEAT 13: Accusing her of not loving him/Accusing him of living in a
fantasy.
    BEAT 14: Blaming her for his failure/Blaming him for his failure.
    Beat 14 climaxes both the second movement and the scene as Ruth
forces Walter to confront his responsibility for his own miserable life.
    BEAT 15: Clinging to his lame excuse/Sneering at his self-deception.
    BEAT 16: Soothing his wounded ego/Retreating into her fears.
    The last two beats are a resolution movement that eases the tension as
Walter retreats into self-pity and Ruth retreats into her secret fears about her
pregnancy.
    A sampling of the gerunds used to name the actions and reactions of
husband and wife lays out the scene’s asymmetrical conflict:
   Walter’s actions: inviting, insisting, blaming, seducing, proving,
accusing, versus Ruth’s reactions: dismissing, hiding, giving in, placating,
ignoring, retreating.
   A sampling of lines reveals the word choices and modals used to carry
out those actions.

   Walter’s aggressive accusations:
   You still call him a loudmouth?
   You wouldn’t do nothing to help, would you?
   A man needs a woman to back him up.
   I’m choking to death, baby!
   Ruth’s passive reactions:
   Oh, Walter Lee…
   Please leave me alone.
   That ain’t none of our money.
   I guess I can’t help myself none.

    The scene arcs its primary values from positive to negative: hope to
despair, security to danger, success to failure, self-respect to self-hatred. As
the scene opens, Walter has hope to gain success and with that, self-respect.
Ruth clings to her hope for security. But the scene’s ever-escalating beats of
action/reaction push Ruth further and further from a secure future, while
driving Walter further and further from his immediate goal of financial
success, and even further from his life-fulfilling desire for self-respect.
What’s more, because we sense that underneath the arguing these two
people love each other, the climax of the scene puts their marriage in
jeopardy. The scene ends on the deeply negative: Walter’s hope turns to
despair; Ruth’s security turns to danger.
    To fully appreciate Hansberry’s genius, notice that as she executes her
immediate task of arcing the scene around its value changes, she also uses
its second movement to set up Walter’s long-term character arc.
    A character arc is a profound change, for better or worse, in a
character’s moral, psychological, or emotional nature, expressed in values
such as optimism/pessimism, maturity/immaturity, criminality/redemption,
and the like. The character’s inner nature may arc from the positive (caring)
to the negative (cruel), as does Michael in THE GODFATHER PART II, or
from the negative (egoist) to the positive (loving), as does Phil in
GROUNDHOG DAY.
    Therefore, the writer must clearly establish the character at the positive
or negative of a value early in the story, so that the audience can understand
and feel the arc of change. Walter is the only character in the play that
undergoes moral change, and so Hansberry ingeniously uses Beats 12 to 16
to set up his nature and need for change.
    In five progressive beats of dialogue, Hansberry expresses Walter’s
desperate desire for self-respect and the respect of his family and
dramatizes that he has neither. After turning Walter’s super-intention to the
negative (wounded pride) in Act 1, Hansberry takes Walter down to an even
deeper hell of self-loathing and familial disgust at the Act 2 climax. At last
she resurrects Walter when he makes a choice and takes an action that wins
him self-respect as well as the love and admiration of his wife and family at
the story climax. Walter’s character arc from self-hatred to self-respect lifts
A Raisin in the Sun well above conventional social dramas about racial
prejudice.


Now let’s take this excellent scene and ruin it. I’ll demonstrate how the
same dialogue beats could have been anti-progressive:
    Suppose Hansberry had started the scene with its turning points: Walter
asks Ruth whether she’d like to know what he’s thinking about and she
says, “I already know. Your father’s life insurance. Walter, that is not our
money! It’s your mother’s. So forget it. And what’s more, I’m tired of
listening to your whining about your misery and blaming me for your failed
life. You, Walter, are responsible for every mistake you’ve ever made.”
    In reaction Walter could still go on about Ruth’s lack of support, the
glories of the liquor store business, how easy it would be to persuade his
mother, how he hates his life and blames Ruth’s typical black woman’s
attitude for it all. The necessary exposition about the money, his plans, his
life, and his feelings about his wife would get out. The audience would
learn what it needs to know but be bored stiff because it realizes that
Walter’s arguments are pointless. Ruth has said “No!” and means it. So,
with zero tension and zero suspense, the scene would bump and crumble
into a rubble of exposition.
    Or I could ruin it another way by bringing in the turning points too late,
elongating the scene by repeating its beats. Walter could expand on all the
money he could have made in the dry-cleaning business; he could sing the
praises of those extraordinary businessmen, Willy and Bobo; he could
glorify the liquor store scheme and describe the furs, jewelry, and new
home he would buy for Ruth and their son with the fortune he would make.
    When she finally nails him with the fact that his mother’s money is not
his, Walter could then launch a century-long history of the black woman as
the black man’s burden—on and on until Ruth shuts him up. Again the
audience loses interest as fact after fact is hammered home over and over.
When the turning points finally arrive, they’d have less than half their full
impact because the exposition has worn down the audience. Notice that
when Hansberry does use repetition, such as Walter’s “egg” speech (Beat
7), it’s to give the actor three drumbeats to build to an emotional peak—but
no more.
    Or worse yet, she could have written the scene with no turning points at
all. She could have poured out three pages of breakfast table talk about
business plans, Mother’s money, their lousy marriage, and the fate of black
men and women. But she didn’t. She wrote a revealing, moving,
progressive scene that beat by beat hits two turning points that in turn set up
her whole play.
    Like the scene we just studied, every scene, ideally, works as both
payoff and setup. Something has changed since the last confrontation
between a scene’s characters. Therefore, what is said now pays off things
that happened in the past. As these payoffs reverberate through the
dialogue, what is said now will in turn set up effects in future scenes.
    And like the examples from THE SOPRANOS and FRASIER,
Hansberry’s skilled creation of Walter Lee carried Sidney Poitier into
nominations for a Tony Award, a Golden Globe, and a BAFTA, the British
Academy of Film and Television Award.
    In the three previous chapters, dramatized scenes called for actors to
strike major chords of heated emotion around wrenching turning points.
Let’s now look at a prose scene with cool tones and muted action.

               INDIRECT CONFLICT


THE GREAT GATSBY

Chapter One of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel introduces the reader to the
story’s narrator, Nick Carraway. Nick has come to New York to begin his
Wall Street career. He has rented a house in West Egg, Long Island. His
neighbor is Jay Gatsby, a fabulously wealthy young man who has made a
fortune as a bootlegger. West Egg is home to the well-to-do, but it is far less
fashionable than its very exclusive counterpart across the bay, East Egg.
Nick’s cousin, the beautiful Daisy, lives in an East Egg mansion with her
wealthy husband, Tom Buchanan, a powerfully built former Ivy League
athlete. The Buchanans invite Nick for dinner, and there he meets Miss
Jordan Baker, a female golf star who, like the Buchanans, is also upper
class.
    Fitzgerald has written his novel in the first person from Nick’s point of
view. Below is Fitzgerald’s subchapter broken into eight beats. The scene
begins with the foursome sipping drinks before dinner. Miss Baker turns to
Nick and says:

BEAT 1
     “You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know
  somebody there.”
     “I don’t know a single—”
     “You must know Gatsby.”
     “Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”


BEAT 2

     Before I could reply that he was my neighbor, dinner was
  announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom
  Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a
  checker to another square.
     Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two
  young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open
  toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the
  diminished wind.

BEAT 3

     “Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out
  with her fingers.


BEAT 4

     “In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She looked at
  us all radiantly. “Do you always watch for the longest day of the year
  and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and
  miss it.”


BEAT 5

      “We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down
  at the table as if she were getting into bed.
      “All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me
   helplessly.
      “What do people plan?”
      Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression
   on her little finger.
      “Look!” she complained. “I hurt it.”
      We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.

BEAT 6

       “You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know you didn’t mean
   to do it but you did do it.

BEAT 7

      “That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great big
   hulking physical specimen of a—”
      “I hate that word ‘hulking’,” objected Tom crossly, “even in
   kidding.”

BEAT 8

      “Hulking,” insisted Daisy.

   That ends the scene.
   Before I begin my analysis, a few words on point of view.
   First, a definition: Point of view is that place in the global space of a
story’s world that the writer or director places us so we can witness the
scene. By global space, I mean the 360 degrees of horizontal angles that
surround a subject, combined with the 360 vertical degrees of angle above
and below the subject.
   In the theatre, we look at the onstage life from that fixed POV of the seat
we purchased. All of the characters’ actions and reactions are in front of us
at all times. We are more or less free to glance from one character to
another at any moment, but that’s our only POV choice, and that choice will
be greatly influenced by the director’s staging as well as the voices and
movements of the actors.
    In television and film, we see what the camera sees. As it moves through
the global storytelling space, it controls but does not rigidly limit our POV.
For as we gather in the establishing shots, supplemented with group shots,
two-shots, or close-ups, and the like, we become aware of life offscreen as
well as onscreen. As a result, we often imagine actions and reactions we do
not in fact see.
    Prose offers the writer the greatest freedom in point of view choices, and
yet at the same time, for the reader, prose is the most controlling storytelling
medium. Like other media, prose can view scenes from anywhere in the
physical world, but it also adds subjective angles within a character’s
mental world. Once the prose writer makes a choice of person (first, third,
or the eccentric second), her eye moves from that angle like a spotlight. The
author holds our perception in her fist.
    As we follow her sentences, she takes us where she wishes: through the
places, times, and societies of her world; or into a single character’s
thought-filled depths, there to witness rationalizations, self-deceptions, and
dreams; or deeper yet, into the character’s subconscious to reveal her raw
appetites, nightmarish terrors, and lost memories.
    When skillfully executed, POV has such power that unless we
deliberately stop, pull out of the telling, and put our imaginations to work,
we are drawn through the tale, seeing and hearing only what the storyteller
wants us to, and no more.
    Therefore, in the following analysis, when I describe Tom Buchanan’s
reaction to Daisy’s abrupt snuffing out of the candles, I am imagining the
scene the way Fitzgerald might have imagined it before he wrote the final
draft. Like all fine writers, Fitzgerald no doubt worked through the scene
draft after draft, adding, cutting, reordering, phrasing, and rephrasing until
he had a sense of its totality. And as he reworked the scene, he likely
imagined it from each and every character’s viewpoint, even though he
knew that he would ultimately control his prose through Nick’s point of
view.
    Now to the scene: Suppose you prepared a romantic candlelit dinner and
your spouse abruptly snuffed out the candles without a word or look to you.
What would you feel? How would you react? Tom must have been
offended. So to analyze the full life of Fitzgerald’s mini-drama, I must re-
create the scene as he envisioned it before he wrote it and include the
reactions that Fitzgerald chose to imply but not describe.


Inciting Incident

As the scene opens, Daisy’s and Tom’s life seems contented and in balance.
The value of marriage/divorce is at its positive charge. But secretly, Daisy
finds married life very tedious. Her inner charge of excitement/boredom sits
at the nadir.


BEAT 1
ACTION: Jordan revealing that Gatsby lives in West Egg.
REACTION: Daisy concealing her surprise.
    Beat 1 triggers the novel’s inciting incident: Daisy discovers that Jay
Gatsby has moved nearby. What’s more, Jordan and Nick know him. This
revelation immediately throws her life out of balance. The positive charge
of marriage/divorce begins to erode toward the negative, while her
excitement for Gatsby resurfaces.
    In her late teens Daisy fell passionately in love with Jay Gatsby. Their
rich girl/poor boy affair ended when Gatsby left to fight in World War I.
Soon after their breakup, the socially ambitious Daisy married the wealthy
Tom Buchanan. In recent years Gatsby has become scandalously rich and
famous. Daisy has no doubt read or heard about his exploits. She may also
have learned that he purchased a huge estate across the bay. In fact, Gatsby
bought the home so he could look across the narrow waters to the lit
windows of her home.
    When Daisy asks, “What Gatsby?” she knows full well it’s Jay Gatsby,
but she cleverly uses the question to conceal her genuine surprise to learn
that her former lover is now a virtual neighbor and, furthermore, that her
friend knows him and her cousin lives near him.
    The realization that Gatsby has moved close to her, undoubtedly drawn
to West Egg because of her, upsets the balance of Daisy’s life and arouses in
her the desire to see him. To renew their love? Have an affair? Leave her
husband? Who can say how far she intends to go? Daisy’s fluidly fickle
nature makes her incapable of decisive plans into the future, but this much
is clear: Her super-intention is, at the very least: to see Jay Gatsby. Gatsby
becomes her object of desire.
    This puts two core values into play: marriage/divorce and
boredom/passion—the security of her marriage versus her passion for
Gatsby. She must risk the former to gain the latter.
    Daisy’s choice: To keep marital peace or go to war? At the top of the
scene, the value charges are positive for Daisy’s marriage (before dinner,
husband and wife are amiable) but negative for Daisy’s passion (Gatsby is
out of reach).
    Beyond seeing Gatsby, exactly what Daisy wants from him, Fitzgerald
deliberately hides in the subtext. But note Daisy’s choice: She risks her
marriage and goes to war with her husband.

BEAT 2
ACTION: All walking to the dinner table.
REACTION: Daisy planning to humiliate Tom.
    Daisy’s problem is that she cannot just pick up a telephone and call
Gatsby. Her pride and vanity won’t allow her. What’s more, if her husband
and the rigid, snobbish society she moves in were to discover that she
pursued the notorious Gatsby, the scandal would ruin her.
    Instantly, instinctively, she decides to put on a show in front of Nick and
Jordan so that one or both will carry a message to Gatsby, a message that
says the Buchanan marriage is in trouble. Daisy takes command of the
scene and drives it to its turning point. Her scene intention becomes: to
humiliate her husband in public. Tom’s scene intention, it’s fair to assume,
is: to avoid public humiliation. These directly opposed desires set the
scene’s terms of antagonism.
    Tom Buchanan has had his household staff set the dinner table with
candles. He may have done it for Daisy’s sake, or perhaps he intended this
romantic touch to encourage Nick and Jordan. Indeed, in time those two
will have a summer affair.
BEAT 3
ACTION: Daisy destroying her husband’s romantic gesture.
REACTION: Tom concealing his annoyance.
    But whatever Tom’s reason, as they step up to the table, the “frowning”
Daisy objects to the candles and snuffs them out with her fingers. Tom
reacts by concealing the hurt she causes him and saying nothing. The
positive charge of marriage declines further as Daisy’s boredom changes
into excitement.

BEAT 4
ACTION: Daisy opening a conversational subject.
REACTION: Daisy turning the subject back to herself.
    In this beat Daisy starts a conversation about the summer solstice, but
before anyone can respond to her strange question, she reacts to her own
action and ends the topic by referring it back to herself. The value charges
of marriage/divorce and excitement/boredom are unaffected and remain the
same as they were in Beat 3.

BEAT 5
ACTION: Jordan and Daisy wondering aloud to the others.
REACTION: Daisy calling attention to her finger.
    The summer season has just begun, so Jordan starts the next beat by
suggesting that they plan something to do. Daisy simply continues that
action by repeating the question twice, not to her husband, but to Nick. But
before Nick can answer, she instantly and literally wraps the conversation
around her little finger. The value charges of marriage/divorce and
excitement/boredom continue on pause.

BEAT 6
ACTION: Daisy accusing Tom of injuring her.
REACTION: Tom hiding his reaction in silence.
  Daisy faces a crisis dilemma: She could insult her husband (negative),
which might send a message to Gatsby (positive), or she could protect her
marriage (positive) but not win Gatsby’s attention (negative). Daisy chooses
to accuse her husband of bruising her finger. Again, Fitzgerald gives Tom
no visible reaction, not a word of protest. The value charge of
marriage/divorce turns dark, while excitement/boredom shines.

BEAT 7
ACTION: Daisy insulting her husband in public.
REACTION: Tom ordering her not to insult him again.
   Daisy, then, with cool irony, insults her husband with a special emphasis
on a word that she knows he hates: hulking. Finally, Tom objects.
   Bear in mind that these are educated, upper-class characters, so when I
use the verb “ordering” to name Tom’s reaction, it’s because that’s what
he’s doing in the subtext. Tom is too well behaved to say, “Damn it, Daisy,
never use the word ‘hulking’ again!” But under the phrase “I hate that
word…” is an indirect command.
   Daisy’s insult throws marriage/divorce sharply to the negative, while in
the subtext, excitement for Gatsby conquers her boredom.

BEAT 8
ACTION: Daisy attacking him a second time.
REACTION: Tom retreating in silence.
   Daisy climaxes the scene by defying her husband’s order and repeating
the hated word with emphasis. In reaction, Tom once more falls silent.
   Daisy wins her marital power struggle in six beats and humiliates Tom.
This duel between husband and wife, Tom’s defeat and Daisy’s victory,
would not be lost on her audience of the very sensitive, observant Nick and
the gossipy Jordan Baker. Daisy knows this. Now she hopes that they’ll
carry the news to Gatsby. Daisy has embarrassed her husband, and it has
had the effect she wants.
   As Daisy chooses Gatsby over Tom, her marriage ends in all but name
while her excitement about the future peaks.
DIALOGUE VERSUS DESCRIPTION IN PROSE

As mentioned previously, prose writers (with exceptions) tend to keep their
dramatized dialogue economical, simple, and plainspoken. Of the scene’s
123 spoken words, 107 are of one syllable, 14 of two syllables, and just 2 of
three syllables. None of the scene’s characters uses metaphors or similes
when they speak.
    Fitzgerald, on the other hand, enriches his descriptions with figurative
language such as “Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though
he were moving a checker to another square” and “… Miss Baker, sitting
down at the table as if she were getting into bed.” When he uses
polysyllabic words, they tend to be adverbs that describe tones of voice
(contemptuously, accusingly, crossly) and actions (slenderly, languidly,
radiantly).
    The scene’s power comes from Daisy’s actions in the subtext, actions
that Nick, limited by his first-person point of view, cannot know. Instead,
Fitzgerald encourages the reader to see through Daisy’s veil of innocence
by dropping hints along the way such as Daisy’s “demand” to know “What
Gatsby?”


TURNING POINT/SCENE CLIMAX

The scene arcs the Buchanan marriage dynamically from positive to
negative in eight beats. In the first beat, their marriage seems respectful and
faithful. By the last beat, Daisy’s actions reveal a marriage filled with
hatred and disrespect as she plots her path back to Gatsby. At the same
time, each negative action against the marriage becomes a positive beat for
Daisy’s desire for the adventure that Gatsby brings to her life. Daisy’s tactic
works: She wins the war against her husband and gives Jordan and Nick the
message they will carry to Gatsby.
    The eight beat progression takes this shape:
    BEAT 1: Revealing/Concealing
    BEAT 2: Walking/Planning
    BEAT 3: Destroying/Concealing
    BEAT 4: Opening a subject/Turning the subject to herself
    BEAT 5: Wondering aloud/Turning attention to herself
    BEAT 6: Accusing/Hiding
    BEAT 7: Insulting/Ordering
    BEAT 8: Attacking/Retreating
    Each beat tops the previous beat, progressing to the turning point when
Daisy defies her husband’s order and humiliates him—each beat, that is,
except Beats 4 and 5. They seem to be a hole in the dialogue’s progression
because they are not aimed at Daisy’s scene intention. Indeed they’re not,
because Fitzgerald uses them for another, larger purpose related to the
novel’s spine of action.
    Notice the pattern in Beats 4 and 5: Daisy asks a question that opens up
a general topic for the others, but then without pause, before anyone can
answer, she instantly draws their interest back to her. Fitzgerald repeats this
pattern in Daisy’s dialogue throughout the book. In ways that are amusing,
sympathetic, or mysterious, Daisy constantly steers all talk back to herself.
In other words, Fitzgerald wants us to understand that Daisy is a very
beautiful, very charming narcissist.
    What is the real reason she creates this scene? Why can’t she defy her
husband, break social convention, and visit Gatsby herself? Why must she
send a veiled message through Jordan and Nick? Because narcissists call
attention to themselves, never others. For Daisy, it is critical that Gatsby
seek her out. Gatsby must come to her. Fitzgerald uses those beats and
many others elsewhere to express the dueling spines of action that drive The
Great Gatsby: Gatsby’s obsession with Daisy and Daisy’s obsession with
Daisy.

             REFLEXIVE CONFLICT


INTRODUCTION TO THE SELF

Chapter One defined dialogue as any words said by any character to
anyone. This traffic of talk runs along three distinct avenues: said to others,
said to a reader or audience, and said to oneself. The chapter that follows
focuses on the latter two tracks: direct address to the reader and inner
dialogue between selves. Although the stage and screen limit the use of
these two modes, for the novelist and short-story writer, they are the stuff of
first-person prose.
    When characters talk directly to the reader, the topic tends to be past
events and their impact on themselves (e.g., The Museum of Innocence),
whereas when characters talk to themselves, their inner dialogue acts out
intra-dynamic events in the now. These dramatizations of self versus self
carry psychological nuance into the depths of the unsayable (e.g., Fräulein
Else). Once again, it’s the difference between telling and showing.
    In the former, a character with less than perfect self-awareness tells us
about past inner conflicts and describes their effects; in the latter, a
character puts her deep psychology into action in front of us and
unknowingly dramatizes inner complexities she could never describe.
Needless to say, telling and showing call upon two very different dialogue
techniques.
    An ancient literary convention grants us the godlike power to overhear a
character’s thoughts, all the while knowing that she is not talking to us. If
so, then to whom is she speaking? Dialogue, by definition, is a two-sided
exchange between a speaker and a listener. Who besides us is listening to
her? If she’s talking to another self within herself, her mind must be dual. If
dual or even multiple, how does her mind divide itself into selves? Exactly
how many are there? Who are they? How do they link?
    These questions are neither new nor unique to storytelling. Twenty-five
hundred years ago, the Buddha taught his followers to ignore all such
wonderings because they flow from the false premise that the self exists,
when in fact it does not. The sense of “me,” he believed, is an illusionary
side effect of uncountable, ever-shifting physical and sensory forces.
    About the same time, Socrates argued the opposite view. He taught his
students that the self not only exists, but you cannot live a meaningful,
civilized life without making every effort to know who you are. In the
centuries since, this debate over the nature of intrapersonal communication
has swung back and forth between these two philosophical extremes and
remains unsettled at best.
    Science, on the other hand, has taken a stand.1 Like Socrates, modern
science strives to know the hidden nature of consciousness, but at the same
time, like Buddha, it feels misled by intuition. While our sixth sense tells us
we have a core of consciousness located behind our eyes, brain scan
researchers report that several different mental processes, mediated by
different brain regions, collaborate to create this illusion. No single, central,
physical, all-controlling self exists; “me” is indeed a side effect. On the so-
called “hard question” of consciousness, neuroscience now favors Buddha
over Socrates but without a clear conclusion.2
    Although science cannot ground consciousness in the physical, and
philosophy cannot locate it in the metaphysical, artists know exactly where
to find the self. When art whistles, the self comes running like a bounding
dog. For the storyteller, the self makes its home in the same subjective
reaches where it has always lived and thrived.
    Delusional or not, consciousness of self is the essence of our humanity.
If, as science tells us, the self is not confined to a specific lobe of the brain
but emerges out of a composite of sources, so what? It’s my composite and
I like it. If, as philosophy claims, the unreliable self shifts and changes from
one day to the next and, therefore, cannot be known absolutely, so what?
It’s my changing self and I enjoy watching it evolve, hopefully into a better
person.
    For prose writers striving to express the inner life, philosophy’s
deductive logic and science’s inductive logic dull aesthetic insight. Neither
leverages the inside-out power of the subjective; neither creates the
meaningful emotional experience of the self that every major work of story
art since Homer inspires. Story doesn’t answer the “hard question”; it
dramatizes it.
    I think the best approach to creating inner dialogue is simply this: Treat
your character’s mind like a setting, a world populated with a cast of
characters called selves. Let the mindscape sprawl like a cityscape,
landscape, or battleground, a mental mise-en-scène for the staging of a
story. Then move into that world yourself and take up residence in the
protagonist’s center of consciousness. From this point of view, create inner
dialogues that dramatize an answer to the question “What is it to be this
particular human being?”
    To return to the question that started this introduction: When a character
talks to herself, who besides the reader is listening? To whom is she
speaking? Answer: the silent self. As we listen to a character talk to herself,
we instinctively know that another side, a quiet side of herself, is listening.
In fact, we know this so instinctively that we never think about it. We don’t
have to because we know, without thinking, that we talk to our personal
silent self constantly.
    Inside every mind, it seems to me, a separate, silent core of being sits
back, watching, listening, evaluating, storing memories. If you meditate,
you know this self very well. It floats behind you, so to speak, watching you
do everything you do, including meditation. If you try to meditate toward
this self, it instantly swings around behind you again. You cannot face
yourself within yourself, but you always know that your silent self is there
and aware, listening to everything you have to say.
    As inner dialogues of prose cycle between the talking self and the silent
self, they generate reflexivity.
REFLEXIVE CONFLICT

In the physical sciences, reflexivity refers to a circular or bidirectional
relationship between cause and effect. An action triggers a reaction that
impacts the action so fast the two seem simultaneous. (Some theories of
quantum physics argue that at the subatomic level cause and effect are in
fact simultaneous.) Action and reaction then lock together, whirling in a
gyre. The cause becomes the effect, the effect becomes the cause, and
neither can be clearly identified as either.
    In the social sciences, reflexivity signals a kind of codependency
between individuals, or within groups, institutions, and societies. Once the
reflexive spiral begins, neither the action nor its reaction can be assigned as
the cause or the effect. The two so intra-influence each other, they seem to
happen instantaneously, without the need for decisions or even thought.
    In the art of story, reflexive conflict refers to those inner battles that
begin when a character’s effort to resolve an inherent dilemma boomerangs
back on herself. By taking her impasse inward, her effort to deal with her
crisis becomes a cause that only worsens the effect. Self-contradictions
generate ever-more complex sources of antagonism as causes become
effects and effects become causes in an ever-deepening whorl until the
conflict itself becomes the reason it cannot be solved.
    Reflexive conflict translates into dialogue the moment a troubled
character starts talking to herself. As I pointed out in Chapter One, the
mind, by its very nature, can step back within itself to observe itself as if it
were an object. A person temporarily splits in two to develop a relationship,
often critical, between her core self and other sides or aspects of herself.
She can project images of her past self, her unattractive self, her better self,
her future self. She can feel the presence of her conscience, her
subconscious, and, above all, her silent, listening self.
    At times these relationships may be conflictless as, for example, when
we comfort ourselves with excuses, self-deceptions, or blame placed on
others. But more often than not, our inner selves strike opposing sides in the
struggle to make choices, do the right thing, sacrifice for another, bring a
troubled self under control—any of the tumultuous contrarieties of the inner
life.3
    Reflexive conflicts can be acted out in the present tense directly or
related indirectly in the past tense. Onstage and onscreen, a character can
perform the former in soliloquy and the latter in either dialogue spoken to
another character or in direct address to the audience. On page, the
protagonist can talk to her other self and act out her inner conflicts in the
present tense (Fräulein Else), or talk to the reader and describe previous
episodes of reflexive conflict in the past tense (The Museum of Innocence).


FRÄULEIN ELSE

Arthur Schnitzler, the Austrian novelist and playwright, experimented with
stream of consciousness throughout his career, beginning in 1901 with the
short story, “Lieutenant Gustl.” In the 1924 novella Fräulein Else, he
invited readers to eavesdrop on the troubled thoughts of its eponymous
protagonist by writing exclusively in first-person inner dialogue.

SETUP
Else, a beautiful nineteen-year-old Viennese debutante, on holiday with her
aunt at an Austrian mountain resort, receives a letter from her mother telling
her that her father, a lawyer, has been caught stealing tens of thousands
from a client’s account. He faces prison or suicide if he can’t pay the money
back in two days.
    Else’s mother begs her to save her father by asking Herr von Dorsday, a
rich art dealer staying at the spa, for a loan to cover the theft. Else, despite
her suffocating shame, asks the old man for help. He says he will telegraph
the funds to cancel her father’s debt the next morning, but only if she repays
him in sexual currency that night.
    These three events—her father’s theft, her mother’s scheme, Dorsday’s
proposition—trigger the story’s inciting incident and throw Else’s life
radically and negatively out of balance. Two contradictory desires
immediately flood her mind: to save her parents and sacrifice herself versus
to save herself and sacrifice her parents. Either way she chooses, a great
price must be paid, because when I say “save herself,” I mean that literally.
Else’s identity is tied to her morality. If she saves her family, she loses her
morality; if she loses her morality, she loses her identity.
    Trapped by this double bind of irreconcilable goods/lesser of two evils,
Else’s only path of action runs between her inner selves. So for the rest of
the afternoon and evening, Else wanders the resort alone, her mind in
reflexive chaos: At first, she tells herself to give in, save her family, and
endure the disgrace; then she contradicts herself, choosing instead to reject
Dorsday, and force her family to pay for its ignominy. At one point, she
tries to cheer herself up, imagining that surrendering to Dorsday could
launch a luxurious career as mistress to rich men, but then her conscience
urges her to defend her moral self and accept poverty with honor.
    Moral dilemmas like this, played out on a protagonist’s mindscape, often
spiral into reflexive conflict. For example, as the moment to meet Dorsday
nears, Else says to herself:

      How huge the hotel is. Like a monstrous, illuminated magic
   castle. Everything is gigantic. The mountains, too. Terrifyingly
   gigantic. They’ve never been so black before. The moon hasn’t risen
   yet. It will rise just in time for the performance, the great
   performance in the meadow, when Herr von Dorsday makes his
   female slave dance naked. What’s Herr von Dorsday to me? Now,
   Mademoiselle Else, what are you making such a fuss about? You
   were ready to go off and be the mistress of strange men, one after the
   other. And you boggle at the trifle which Herr von Dorsday asks of
   you? You were ready to sell yourself for a pearl necklace, for
   beautiful clothes, for a villa by the sea? And your father’s life isn’t
   worth as much as that?”

Reflexive Dialogue
Fourteen thoughts ricochet through this passage of inner dialogue. In the
first seven (from “How huge” to “hasn’t risen yet”) Else’s imagination
projects her terror and sense of frailty onto the frightening, enormous,
almost unreal world around her. The word “magic” gives away her childlike
state.
    Then her mind grabs the last word of the seventh sentence, “yet,” and
free-associates to an image of her future self, naked and dancing in the
moonlight. With the rhetorical question “What’s Herr von Dorsday to me?”
she tries to shrug off the insinuations in the word “slave” and feign
indifference.
    But suddenly, her mind seems to segue into another self, armed with a
sharp, critical voice. For the next five lines this critical self whiplashes
Else’s core self with a series of “Damned if you do/damned if you don’t”
insults. The critical self calls her a hypocrite, “such a fuss” (damned if you
don’t); then a slut, “mistress of strange men” (damned if you do); then a
coward, “you boggle” (damned if you don’t); then a slut again, “sell
yourself” (damned if you do); and finally an ingrate, “your father’s life”
(damned if you don’t).
    Else’s mind spins in reflexive conflict: “Which do I want to be? A jewel-
decked whore or a cowardly ingrate?” She dreads both and wants neither,
but question mark after question mark paralyzes her until the passage ends
in mental gridlock. Spoiler alert: At the climax of the novel, Else’s impasse
explodes into an act of wild exhibitionism and a drug overdose.
    As we have seen in previous examples, emotions tend to shorten lines,
while rationality tends to lengthen them. As fear races through Else, her
first seven thoughts average 4.1 words each. But then the critical self takes
charge and the next seven lines average 14.5 words.

Writing In-Character
When Arthur Schnitzler published Fräulein Else, he was a sixty-two-year-
old man writing in the first-person inner voice of a nineteen-year-old
socialite. How is this possible? First, he wrote plays as well as prose, so his
dramatist skills must have helped him find words for this character. Then,
life experience. He married a twenty-one-year-old actress when he was
forty-one. In fact, over a lifetime he had many affairs with young women.
Each must have given him a chance to hear a fresh voice and imagine life
from a new and female point of view.
    But my best guess is this: In addition to talent, skill, and a practiced ear,
Schnitzler could act. Maybe not in front of an audience, but at his desk and
pacing his study. He became her. He wrote in-character, a technique we will
explore in Chapter Nineteen.


THE MUSEUM OF INNOCENCE

Orhan Pamuk published The Museum of Innocence two years after winning
the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature. He worked long and hard with novelist
Maureen Freely to perfect the English translation. The English edition,
rather than the original Turkish, was the likely basis for further translations
(sixty languages to date), and so its faithfulness was critical.

SETUP
Pamuk’s novel tells a story of love at first sight and its conflict-filled
aftermath. Kemal, a Turkish businessman, has converted a house in Istanbul
into a repository of mementos and memories he calls The Museum of
Innocence. Like the Taj Mahal, the museum celebrates love. In Kemal’s
case, nine passionate years with Füsun, his exquisitely beautiful lover and
eventual wife, now deceased.
    The author’s unique narrative strategy places Kemal inside the museum,
where he acts as docent and guide to its exhibits. Pamuk then treats the
reader as a visitor to the museum, allowing Docent Kemal to speak to the
reader in first person as if the reader were the museum’s guest.
    Nine tumultuous, love-soaked years have seasoned Docent Kemal to
maturity. But living in his memory is the museum’s main exhibit: Kemal’s
previous, immature, ultra-romantic self. Throughout Kemal’s youth, this
self feverously sought something he could not grasp. He told himself he
was in love with Füsun and, up to a point, he was. But deep within, his true
obsession was a passion for passion. He quested after that ancient and
elusive absolute: the life-fulfilling, transcendent romantic experience. Füsun
merely played a role in his all-consuming drama.
    Obsessive romantics devour the rites of romance: quiet walks in
moonlight, tireless lovemaking, candlelit dinners, champagne, classical
music, poetry, sunsets, and the like. But these enthralling rituals are
pointless without an exquisite creature to share them, and so the man-in-
love-with-romance tragedy begins when he falls for a woman because, and
only because, she is gorgeous. Young Kemal, in other words, suffered from
the curse of beauty: that insatiable craving for the sublime that makes living
a simple life unthinkable.
    Having created these two selves, Docent Kemal and Romantic Kemal,
the author needed to characterize the two voices and solve three dialogue
problems: 1) In what tone and manner would the Docent Self speak to a
visitor? 2) How would the Docent Self express the Romantic Self’s silent
inner dialogue? 3) When we hear Romantic Kemal speak, what qualities
would texture his voice?
    The passage below answers those questions as Docent Kemal talks to us:

       I have here the clock, and these matchsticks and matchbooks,
   because the display suggests how I spent the slow ten or fifteen
   minutes it took me to accept that Füsun was not coming that day. As
   I paced the rooms, glancing out the windows, stopping in my tracks
   from time to time, standing motionless, I would listen to the pain
   sluicing within me. As the clocks in the apartment ticked away, my
   mind would fixate on the seconds and the minutes to distract myself
   from the agony. As the appointed hour neared, the sentiment “Today,
   yes, she’s coming, now” would bloom inside me, like spring flowers.
   At such moments I wanted time to flow faster so that I could be
   reunited with my lovely at once. But those minutes would never pass.
   For a moment, in a fit of clarity, I would understand that I was
   fooling myself, that I did not want the time to flow at all, because
   Füsun might never come. By two o’clock I was never sure whether to
   be happy that the hour had arrived, or sad that with every passing
   minute her arrival was less likely, and the distance between me and
   my beloved would grow as that between a passenger on a ship
   leaving port and the one he had left behind. So I would try to
   convince myself that not so very many minutes had passed, toward
   this end I would make little bundles of time in my head. Instead of
   feeling pain every second of every minute, I resolved to feel it only
   once every five! In this way I would take the pain of five discrete
   minutes and suffer it all in the last. But this too was for naught when
   I could no longer deny that the first five minutes had passed—when I
   was forced to accept that she was not coming, the forestalled pain
   would sink into me like a driven nail…

    Docent Kemal begins this passage in the present tense as if he were
standing in front of an exhibit case filled with heirlooms and speaking to a
visitor. But The Museum of Innocence is primarily a temporal museum; its
chief artifacts are episodes from a love story, taken out of time and placed
in its galleries. So Docent Kemal switches to the past tense as he puts
Romantic Kemal, trapped in an archived event, on display.
    Docent Kemal quotes Romantic Kemal just once with four present-tense
phrases: “today,” “yes,” “she’s coming,” and “now,” uttered with the
staccato of excitement. Other than this exception, Docent Kemal leaves the
implied line-by-line thoughts of Romantic Kemal’s inner dialogue to the
reader/visitor’s imagination. In the sixth sentence, a third self, Critical
Kemal, appears briefly to chide Romantic Kemal for his childish self-
deceptions.
    Docent/guest is a ceremonial relationship, more formal than
professor/student. Professors and their students engage in the excitement of
ideas, but the docent and museum guest join in a solemn reverence for the
past. Therefore, Docent Kemal’s dialogue pours out flowing, elegiac
sentences.
    The passage runs 325 words long in eleven sentences that average 29.5
words each. Subordinate clauses in series build each sentence to a mini-
climax: “pain sluicing within me,” “distract myself from the agony,”
“Füsun might never come,” and so on. The passage’s formality and grace
also suggest that Docent Kemal has relived this scene again and again,
recited it to many guests many times, perfecting his wording with each
rendition.
    Although Docent Kemal is no longer the hopeless romantic he once was,
nostalgia for romance still fills his voice. He is as much poet as docent. So
to characterize his protagonist’s heightened romantic imagination, Pamuk
interlaces Docent Kemal’s descriptions with metaphors and similes. Here
and there the docent resorts, as people do, to clichés: sugar-sweet images
such as thoughts blooming like spring flowers inside Romantic Kemal, and
the tear-streaked B-movie scene of a passenger on a departing ship gazing
back at a beloved left on shore. Docent Kemal’s most personal language,
however, goes dark and animates pain: Liquid pain flows through his body,
then takes the form of a driven nail. In the most vivid image of all, he
transforms time into the conduit for pain, complete with a mental valve, as
it were, that can turn it on and off.
    Of the passage’s eleven sentences, the word “would” finds its way into
all but the first line. “Would” is the past tense of the verb “will,” but in this
context the author uses it as a modal to create a soft sense of uncertainty.
    Feel, for example, the difference between the hard versus the soft
expression of the same ideas: “I listen to” and “my mind fixates on” as
opposed to “I would listen to” and “my mind would fixate on.” Instead of
the phrase “pain sunk into me,” the translator uses “pain would sink into
me” to give the moment a sense of melancholy. Overall, the frequent
repetition of “would” softens the hard edge of reality and spreads an aura of
things happening as much in its characters’ imaginations as in an actual
room in the actual past.
    The phrase “would never” intimates unknown repetitions; “would try”
hints at hope and wishing. Taken together, ten “woulds” yield an air of
things that may or may not happen. The word “suggests” and the phrase
“ten or fifteen” further distend this shifting atmosphere, until Docent
Kemal’s dialogue sounds like what it is: a memory in the mind of a failed
romantic.

Reflexive Conflict
Pamuk’s writing draws its energy from two sources of reflexive conflict: the
tyranny of love and the tyranny of time.
    The tyranny of love: While engaged to another woman, Romantic
Kemal met Füsun, a beautiful shop clerk. The lightning of love at first sight
struck, and his life veered out of control on a trajectory aimed at the
transcendent romantic experience. Romantic Kemal blames fate, but fate is
the excuse we use when our subconscious pries our hands off the wheel of
life.
    The arch-romantic wants his beloved with him every minute of every
hour of every day. Suffering her absence causes more suffering as the agony
of loneliness feeds on itself, making her absence all the more acute. The
more he thinks about it, the worse it gets. If and when she were to finally
show up, who knows how his mood might have reversed.
    The tyranny of time: The clock on the wall measures time, but our inner
Big Ben has no hands. Sometimes hours vanish in a glance; sometimes a
minute drags by longer than an arctic February. Romantic Kemal tries
concentrating on time because he thinks it will soothe his torment: “As the
clocks in the apartment ticked away, my mind would fixate on the seconds
and the minutes to distract myself from the agony.” But fixating on time
makes its passage all the more excruciating. He tries to bring time under
control by bundling it, parsing it, speeding it, slowing it, but his battle to
rein time only gives time all the more power to torture him.
    This is the nature of reflexivity: The character inflicts it on himself and
then persists in stirring its poison. Needless to say, reflexive conflict offers
the storyteller soaring dialogue opportunities.
    A final note: Docent Kemal portrays Romantic Kemal’s passion with a
powerful and yet self-obsessed intensity. When Füsun doesn’t show up, he
might have thought: “My God, did something happen to her? Is she hurt?”
But he didn’t. Instead, he dissected his painful anticipation of pleasure to
the microsecond. For the romantic, it is, as we say, always about him.
                                  18


                MINIMAL CONFLICT


INTRODUCTION: THE BALANCE OF TEXT AND
SUBTEXT

Every line of dialogue strikes a balance between the literal meaning of the
words said and the unsaid meanings that the reader/audience senses
resounding through the subtext.
    When this balance tilts so that a minor motivation causes a massive
vocal response, dialogue sounds hollow and the scene feels forged. Recall
the definition of melodrama from Chapter Six: the overwrought expression
of limp needs. Like chefs who use rich sauces to hide spoiled food, writers
who whip up blubbery stylistics to smother stale content risk the sour odor
of melodrama.
    When balance levels out so that unsaid thoughts and feelings transcribe
directly and fully into what is said, we call this blatancy writing on-the-
nose. If a scene’s implicit and explicit meanings echo each other, subtext
turns into text, depth dries up, lines sound tinny, and the acting clanks.
    When the balance favors content over form, when minimal words
express maximal meaning, dialogue gains its greatest credibility and power.
Using Robert Browning’s famous phrase, “Less is more.”1 Any word that
can be cut should be cut, especially if its loss adds to the line’s effect.
Sparseness of language gives the reader or audience a chance to peer ever
more deeply into the unsaid and unsayable. With few exceptions, when
understatement takes the upper hand, dialogue resonates.
   What follows is a superb example of the fewest possible words used to
express the maximum possible feeling and meaning.


LOST IN TRANSLATION

Sofia Coppola wrote and directed LOST IN TRANSLATION when she was
thirty-two. It was her fourth script to reach the screen and her second
feature to direct. The film won numerous awards around the world,
including an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.
    Coppola grew up surrounded by artists, she has traveled to Japan many
times, and, like all of us, she has won and lost at love. So although it’s fair
to assume that personal experience influenced Coppola’s storytelling, it
would be a mistake to treat LOST IN TRANSLATION as autobiography.
Rather, her writing expresses the widely read, finely tuned mind of an artist
who uses fiction to express her insights into life’s secret places.
    In Coppola’s minimalist writing, dialogue progression does not use
arguments to sling words like stones (the conjugal hostilities of A Raisin in
the Sun) or manipulations to weave words into a trap (Daisy’s malicious
feigning in The Great Gatsby). Instead, subtle, indirect, sparse language
shapes implicit, virtually invisible but deeply felt conflicts that haunt her
characters out of their pasts and into the present.
    In the scene below, Coppola works into the inner selves and past selves
of her characters simultaneously. She reveals both in each without resorting
to choices under the pressure of dilemma.
    Choices between irreconcilable goods and the lesser of two evils, once
poised, are profoundly revealing of true character but relatively easy to
dramatize. Coppola takes another path: Her characters are not in conflict
with what life imposes but with the emptiness of what life denies. This
quiet scene hooks, holds, and pays off without direct, indirect, or reflexive
conflict.

SETUP
The key to creating a scene of minimum dialogue and maximum impact is
its setup. If, prior to a scene, the storytelling has brought characters to crisis
points in their lives, the reader/audience can sense their needs swirling in
the subtext. These desires may or may not be conscious, but the
reader/audience knows them, feels them, and waits in high tension to see
how they play out. A well-prepared reader/audience reads chapters of
content implied behind a phrase or gesture.
    LOST IN TRANSLATION perfects this technique. The film’s opening
scenes crosscut to counterpoint dual protagonists: Charlotte, a recent Yale
graduate, traveling with her photographer husband, versus Bob Harris, a
middle-aged Hollywood star, famous for action roles. As the two settle into
the Park Hyatt Tokyo, we see their differences of age (at least thirty years),
fame (everyone ignores Charlotte; everyone fawns on Bob), and marriage
(she needs her husband’s attention; he wishes his wife would leave him
alone).
    That day, they notice each other in passing twice—once in an elevator
and later in the lounge. That night, neither can sleep, so they make their
way to the hotel bar where they meet by chance.

Scene Intentions
As the scene opens, Charlotte and Bob seem to share a simple need: to kill
time over a drink. But if all they really wanted was a drink, they could have
opened their minibars. Instead, an unthought wish for someone to talk to
sends them out of their rooms. Once they see each other, their scene
intention becomes: to kill time with talk.


Scene Values
As Charlotte nears Bob sitting at the bar, tension rises. Earlier that day, she
and he exchanged a smile, but suppose he turns out to be an arrogant bore,
or he discovers that she’s a lunatic fan. The question “Should I talk to this
stranger or drink alone?” runs through the minds of both. Those doubts
charge the tension of comfortable isolation versus risky intimacy that opens
the scene and inflects their choices.
    Once they dare to converse, however, a deeper, instinctive need inspires
them to move from a chat to confession. As they reveal unpleasant home
truths about themselves, intimacy wins out over isolation. That step then
ignites yet another value: lost in life versus found in life. Lost/found
becomes the story’s core value.
    As the film’s title suggests, Bob and Charlotte, each in their own way,
feel lost. When the scene opens, lost/found sits squarely at the negative.
Over the course of the scene, it never touches the positive; rather, it sinks to
the bleakness of Beat 15. At the same time, however, the charge of
isolation/intimacy arcs toward the light and by the capping beat, their
relationship touches an immediate and natural closeness.
    At the end of each beat, I have scored its value charge (+) for positive,
(-) for negative, (++) for doubly positive, etc.
    Read the scene (printed in bold) straight through to get a feel of the
dialogue’s minimalist language. Then review it against my notes on the arc
of its beats, subtext, and value charges.
     INT. PARK HYATT BAR—NIGHT

     Bob sits alone over a drink.



BEAT 1
                                            BOB
                                       (to the Barman)
         He got married a couple of times to some nice women, beautiful women, too, I
         mean you and I would be crazy for these women, but there were always
         rumors. I never liked his acting, so I never gave a damn whether he was
         straight or not.

ACTION: Bob trying to impress the Barman.
REACTION: The Barman pretending he’s impressed.
Intimacy/Isolation (-)
    Rather than starting with that all-too-familiar image of a solitary man
sitting at a bar, staring into the back of his head, Coppola opens the scene
with showbiz chitchat. A Hollywood star gossiping to a Japanese Barman
makes Bob’s loneliness character-specific and poignant. This first beat hits
an amusing note that counterpoints the dark beat that climaxes the scene.


BEAT 2

     Charlotte steps up to the bar. The Barman pulls out a stool near Bob.

                                         CHARLOTTE
                                          (to Barman)
         Thank you.

                                            (to Bob)
         Hi.

                                     (to Barman as she sits)
         Thanks.

ACTION: The Barman seating her.
REACTION: Charlotte fitting in.
Intimacy/Isolation (-)
    When composing a scene, ask this question before committing to any
line of dialogue: At this precise moment, what are my character’s choices of
action? Which tactic could she take? Which does she take? Every choice of
tactic suggests a quality in the character’s nature and determines the words
she’ll use to carry it out. Once again, dialogue is the outer result of inner
action.
    So, what are Charlotte’s reactions, choices, and tactics as she enters this
all-but-deserted bar and sees a world-famous movie star sitting on a stool
alone? She could be intimidated and leave, she could give him his privacy
and take a table, or she could sit within talking distance.
    As the Barman offers her a stool, she makes the boldest choice of the
three and joins Bob. Her choice to sit, at the risk of embarrassment,
expresses poise.


BEAT 3
                                           BARMAN
        What can I get you?

                                         CHARLOTTE
        Hmmm… I’m not sure… hmmm.

ACTION: The Barman attending to her.
REACTION: Charlotte testing her welcome.
Intimacy/Isolation (-)
    Again, choices: Charlotte could have ordered her favorite drink
immediately. But tensed by the risk she’s taking, she hesitates and gives
Bob a chance to react. What he does now tells her whether or not she’s
actually welcome.


BEAT 4
                                              BOB
                                     (quoting his commercial)
        For relaxing times, make it—

                                        BOB & BARMAN
                                           (in unison)
        “Suntory time!”

                                         CHARLOTTE
        I’ll have a vodka tonic.

    Bob glances at her, impressed.

ACTION: Bob making her feel at home.
REACTION: Charlotte joining in.
REACTION: Bob endorsing her choice.
Intimacy/Isolation (+)
    Bob’s choice of self-ridicule makes her feel welcome. As she orders a
serious drink, he nods in approval, and their sense of intimacy versus
isolation moves toward the positive. Two strangers settle in to talk.
    Bob’s self-ridicule announces a character dimension: Actors take their
work, even in commercials, seriously, but he chooses to mock himself. This
choice of action reveals an inner contradiction between his artist’s pride and
self-disdain.


BEAT 5
                                        CHARLOTTE
                         (to Bob as the Barman leaves for her drink)
        So what are you doing here?

                                              BOB
        Couple of things… Taking a break from my wife, forgetting my son’s birthday,
        and, ah, getting paid two million dollars to endorse a whiskey when I could be
        doing a play somewhere.

                                        CHARLOTTE
                                      (staring in disbelief)
        Oh.

ACTION: Charlotte inviting a conversation.
REACTION: Bob confessing to his three chief failures in life.
REACTION: Charlotte concealing her shock.
Lost/Found (--)
    Charlotte opens a door to the unexpected. If you were her, imagine your
reaction as you sit next to a world-famous movie star whom you think leads
an enviable lifestyle, ask him how he’s doing, and, offhandedly, he tells you
that his life is misery. The phrase “taking a break” doesn’t tell Charlotte
whether Bob blames himself, his wife, or both for his marital problems, but
he clearly damns himself for forgetting his son’s birthday and, most of all,
for corrupting his creative life by choosing money over art.
    Bob’s declaration of failure not only surprises Charlotte, but it crosses a
red line—that formal distance we traditionally keep between strangers and
ourselves. His trespass puts Charlotte under a bit of pressure. Now that the
personal value of lost/found has entered the conversation, she wonders if
she should take a giant step toward intimacy and add her confession to his.
She does. Bob’s revelation wrenches their chat into cycles of confession.
BEAT 6

                                           BOB
        But the good news is the whiskey works.

    She laughs.

ACTION: Bob soothing her feelings.
REACTION: Charlotte sympathizing.
Intimacy/Isolation (+)
    This beat of mutual empathy takes them a smidge closer to intimacy.
Bob’s confession in Beat 5 upset her, but he’s sensitive enough to see what
he has done and regret it. He quickly softens the moment with a joke. She,
in return, sees that he’s embarrassed, so she laughs in sympathy to ease his
chagrin.


BEAT 7
                                           BOB
        What are you doing?

                                       CHARLOTTE
        Hmmm, ah, my husband’s a photographer, so he’s working, and, hmmm, I
        wasn’t doing anything, so I came along. And we have some friends who live
        here.

ACTION: Bob inviting her confession.
REACTION: Charlotte confessing to an empty, perhaps troubled personal
life.
Lost/Found (--)
    From the moment their eyes met in Beat 4, they communicate openly
and honestly. Cocktail chat becomes in vino veritas. In Beat 5 Bob dared an
intimate confession, and now he tempts her to join him. Once again
choices: She could have replied, “Oh, I’m having a wonderful time. My
husband’s on a photo shoot and I’m enjoying some old friends.” Instead,
her passive, tepid phrases imply the unflattering truth of her married life.
Bob reads her troubled subtext.


BEAT 8

     Bob lights her cigarette.

                                            BOB
         How long have you been married?

                                     CHARLOTTE
         Oh, thank you.

                                           (pause)
         Two years.

                                            BOB
         Twenty-five long ones.

ACTION: Bob readying his pass.
REACTION: Charlotte preparing to take it.
REACTION: Bob making his pass.
Intimacy/Isolation (--)
    Charlotte has just confessed that her married life is unfulfilling, so Bob
cannot resist making a pass at this beautiful young woman by complaining
about his unfulfilled married life.
    Note how Coppola has the older man make his move: He reacts to his
own action. He asks Charlotte how long she’s been married, knowing that
whatever number she might name, he can top it with a quarter century of
dissatisfaction.
    Note also Charlotte’s choice. As he lights her cigarette, she sees the pass
coming and could have deflected it by answering, “Two wonderful years,”
or more aggressively, with a question of her own, “Why do you ask?”
Instead, she lets it skate.
    But make no mistake. This is a sexual proposition. How serious is hard
to say. Bob could be doing it out of masculine ritual, but when a middle-
aged guy laments his lengthy, less-than-happy marriage to a young woman
at a bar, he’s hoping for more than sympathy.
    Bob’s pass could push Charlotte away, but instead, she moves closer:


BEAT 9

                                         CHARLOTTE
        You’re probably having a midlife crisis.

                                             (pause)
        Did you buy a Porsche yet?

                                              BOB
                                            (amused)
        You know, I was thinking about buying a Porsche.

ACTION: Charlotte foiling his pass.
REACTION: Bob complimenting her wit.
Intimacy/Isolation (+)
    Charlotte knows his pass is halfhearted at best, and so she teases him
about his age in order to say “No” with a touch of kindness. He graciously
acknowledges her wit.


BEAT 10
                                         CHARLOTTE
        Twenty-five years… that’s, ah… well, it’s impressive.

                                              BOB
        Well, you figure, you sleep one-third of your life. That knocks off eight years of
        marriage right there. So you’re, you know, you’re down to sixteen and change,
        and, you know, you’re just a teenager… like marriage… you can drive it, but
        you can… there’s still the occasional accident.

                                         CHARLOTTE
                                           (laughing)
        Yeah…
ACTION: Charlotte offering a silver lining.
REACTION: Bob confessing his rocky marriage.
REACTION: Charlotte complimenting his wit.
Lost/Found (--)
    From previous scenes, we know Charlotte has doubts about her husband
and her future. When she tries to compliment Bob’s marriage, he reminds
her of a reality she knows from her own life: Relationships rarely live up to
our dreams. Bob softens that harsh truth with a deft comparison of marriage
to teen driving, but his cynical answer offers no hope. Nonetheless,
Charlotte laughs to compliment his insight.
    Note that Beats 4, 5, 8, and 10 play in three steps, rather than the
conventional two. Normally, a new action immediately follows an
action/reaction. Instead, these beats run action/reaction/reaction. When a
reaction triggers yet another reaction, it often signals a deeper connection
between the characters, a greater sense of intimacy.
    As Oscar-winning screenwriter Philip Yordan put it: “Do not drown
your script with endless dialogue and long speeches. Every question does
not call for a response. Whenever you can express an emotion with a silent
gesture, do so. Once you pose the question, permit it to linger before you
get a reply. Or better yet, perhaps the character cannot reply; he or she has
no answer. This permits the unspoken response to hang in midair.”

        Yes… well, hmmm, so far it’s pro bono.

                                             BOB
         Me, too.
    Another long pause.

ACTION: Charlotte confessing she feels lost within herself.
REACTION: Bob confessing that he, too, feels lost.
Lost/Found (---)
Intimacy/Isolation (++++)
    The lines “I wish I could sleep” and “Me, too” intimate a subtext of
suffering as moving as any I can remember.
    Sleep restores sanity. Without it, existence becomes a mad, ticking
clock. When you toss and turn, unstoppable racing thoughts send worries
and fears swirling and churning through the mind. Charlotte and Bob
cannot sleep. Why not? Jet lag? Racing thoughts?
    In my reading of the subtext, their sleeplessness has a deeper cause. As
their confessions reveal, they feel cast off from their marriages, adrift in
their working lives, and at sea within themselves. A hollow place has
opened up inside both that neither family nor work can fill. Charlotte and
Bob have lost their purpose in life.

Character and Dialogue
As the film’s title suggests, the co-protagonists cannot translate their
emptiness into fullness; they cannot imagine their future; they cannot
interpret life’s absurdity into meaning. In more romantic times, Charlotte
and Bob would have been known as “lost souls.”
    Notice how Coppola’s aesthetic avoids verbal combat and uses casual,
offhanded behavior to imply private battles waged behind a smile. She then
squeezes vast content into the fewest, simplest monosyllables: “Well, I’m
sure you’ll figure out the angles,” and “Yeah, I hope your Porsche works
out.” How does she do it?
    First, backstory. Like the scene from The Museum of Innocence,
Coppola could have her characters narrate past conflicts vividly and
explicitly. Instead, she keeps the dramas offscreen and implicit. Bob and
Charlotte narrate three stories apiece—marriage, career, and private self.
They end each storyline in a loss and do it with superb economy of
language. Bob: “taking a break from my wife/endorsing a whiskey when I
could be doing a play.” Charlotte: “he’s working and I wasn’t doing
anything.” They tell each unhappy tale with a charm, wit, and self-mockery
that guides us around their world-weary facades to their ongoing inner
conflicts.
    Second, the pause for subtext. Notice how Bob and Charlotte enter
sentences on glides such as “Well…,” “Yeah…,” and “Yes…,” putting a
thought-filled mini-pause before most everything they say. The actors also
space their words with vocalized moments of reflection such as “Oh…,”
“Ah…,” and “Hmmm…,” plus non-vocalized reactions of laughter, nods,
glances, pauses with eye contact, and pauses staring into space. These
hesitations, short and long, halt the words coming out of the character and
invite the audience inside. A mini-pause opens space for thought.
    Third, naturalistic characterizations. In many of his lines, Bob Harris, a
world-famous action actor, sounds in-character. Phrases such as “I never
gave a damn whether he was straight or not,” “figure the angles,” “a good
buck in that racket,” and “the whiskey works” could have been said by any
of the tough-guy characters he plays. Now they infuse his personality.
    Charlotte’s vocabulary, in sharp contrast to Bob’s, consists of passive
verbs and generalized nouns, absent a single adjective, adverb, or
superlative that might add color: “I hope,” “I wish I could,” and “I’m not
sure” said twice. Her tone is pleasant but her vocabulary reflects her
achromatic, motionless life.

Value Progression and Dialogue
Once we separate the activity of talk from the actions the characters take,
the shape of the scene shines through, as escalating value charges progress
the dialogue from the first beat to the last.
    Coppola designed her scene as a downward spiral that builds its negative
power three times over. She progresses it through a series of tumbling
confessions that take loss from bad to worse to worst.
    First, Bob confesses that as a husband and a father, he’s a fraud, faking
his way through his personal life (bad). Charlotte confesses that she’s just
tagging along after a husband who loves his work more than her (bad). Bob
confesses that he’s a sellout. He should be working as a serious actor;
instead, he’s pushing booze (worse). Charlotte admits that she has no career
or even the plans for one, and so her life outside of marriage has no
direction and no purpose (worse). Then the last beat takes them to the
basement. They each confess that they cannot sleep (the worst).
    By building the scene around confessions, Coppola peels away the
characters’ personae, so they can see each other for who they are. These lost
souls confess to expose themselves. To be seen.
    Why do these confessions feel progressive and not random? To begin
with, Bob and Charlotte live parallel lives: Both have failed in all of life’s
arenas. Coppola then composes their confessions so that they alternate in
descending order. Which is worse? A personal loss in your private
relationships or a professional loss in your working life?
    Professional failure. Why? Because failed relationships are a mutual
loss. Neither person is entirely blameless, nor entirely at fault. When a
relationship fails, you can lighten your load of guilt by heaping it on your
partner.
    When you lose in your chosen career, however, you know the fault is
yours alone. We may make excuses and blame “the system” or bad luck, but
in our heart of hearts we know that if we lose in our calling, it will be due to
our lack of discipline, talent, knowledge, judgment, or hard work… the
usual gaps that spell professional disaster.
    But still, is professional failure always worse than relationship failure?
Does losing a job mean more than breaking up a marriage? The key to the
bar scene is a build toward a loss of identity. So the question is not one of
getting or losing a job; it’s one of gaining or losing your identity.
    If, for example, a woman were married and had a job clerking at
Walmart, then a loss of relationship may prove worse than being fired,
because the woman’s likely source of identity comes more from marriage
than a job.
    But neither of this film’s characters identifies with a marital relationship.
Bob and Charlotte find their identities in themselves as artists. Therefore,
for Bob and Charlotte, professional failure is far worse than relationship
failure. Charlotte has made no effort to even name her ambition, let alone
build a career. Later in the film, she hints at wanting to be a writer, but to
date, she hasn’t written anything. Who but Charlotte is to blame for that?
Bob is rich, famous, and in demand, but he chooses to waste his time and
talent mugging for a liquor spot. Again, who but Bob is to blame for that?
    Coppola’s next twist of the knife is this: Which is worse? Professional
failure or loss of self? Loss of self. Why? Because if we wanted to, we
could decide that careers, fame, fortune, and even creative achievement are
fleeting and illusionary. We could escape the public realm. Fine, but we
have to live somewhere. If we cannot find our place in personal
relationships, if we cannot find self-worth in professional achievement,
what’s left? We must look inside and find a life of value within our being.
    The dilemma at the heart of LOST IN TRANSLATION creates an
existential crisis. Bob and Charlotte have no visible reason to be unhappy.
They seem well educated, well off, well married, and surrounded by friends
—in Bob’s case, by a world of fans. No, Bob and Charlotte are not lonely;
they are lost.
    The difference is this: You’re lonely when you have something to share
but no one to share it with. You’re lost when you have nothing to share, no
matter with whom you live. Of course, you can be both lonely and lost, but
of the two, lost inflicts the greater pain.
    Below are the beat by beat gerunds of action/reaction with the value
charges they cause. Overall, the positive charges of isolation/intimacy
alternate with the negative charges of lost/found to pace the scene
dynamically without repetition:
    BEAT 1: Impressing/Pretending

    BEAT 14: Celebrating/Celebrating
    Intimacy/Isolation (+++)
    BEAT 15: Confessing/Confessing
    Lost/Found Life (---)
    Intimacy/Isolation (++++)
    The personal revelations of losses in Beats 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 13
continually top each other in terms of the damage to their lives. In Beats 10
through 12, the characters’ confessions become all the more honest and all
the more sad. When Charlotte and Bob toast the wreckage in Beats 13 and
14, their newfound intimacy lifts the mood for an instant, but it turns
sharply into the powerful irony of Beat 15.
    In the pause that follows their third and most painful confession (“I wish
I could sleep”/”Me, too”), each suddenly recognizes a kindred spirit. Their
immediate desire is realized in Beat 15 as their lives shift from Isolation (-)
to Intimacy (++++). With irony, of course: They can’t sleep (--), but they
can talk (++); they’re lost souls (---) who connect with a mirror soul
(++++).
    When you survey the gerunds that name their actions, notice how
Charlotte and Bob mirror each other. When two people sit at a bar,
unconsciously imitating each other’s posture and gestures, then echoing
each other’s subtextual actions, they connect with an intimacy they
themselves may not realize.
    The scene climaxes on an overall positive irony and a glimmer of hope.
This quiet but surprisingly dynamic scene arcs from easy rapport to bleak
loss to the possibility of love. The last beat hooks strong suspense for the
rest of the film: Now that Bob and Charlotte have joined forces, will they
grow into lives found?

           MASTERING THE CRAFT


LISTEN

To master the technique of saying little but expressing much, first train your
eye to see into the depths of the unsaid and the unsayable inside the people
around you, then train your ear to hear the said. William Goldman, perhaps
the finest writer of dialogue in film history, has often been complimented
for having “the best ear in Hollywood.” If you think about it, however, the
expression “an ear for dialogue” seems odd.
    The phrase conveys an image of a writer with reportorial or stenographic
gifts riding on buses and listening to the people around him talking, and
then writing down what they say quickly and accurately. Well, I know
William Goldman, and it has been a long time since he got around New
York on buses. But wherever Goldman finds himself, he listens in a writer’s
way, in depth, and so he hears far more than words said.
    Listen to life. From infanthood on, the future writer actively listens to
real-world voices—their rhythms, tones, and jargons. No matter where you
are, now and then eavesdrop on people, take mental notes, or jot down
interesting turns of phrase and what they imply.
    Talking is doing. So like William Goldman, listen to people on two
levels: text versus subtext, what they say versus what they do. Listen to
their word choices and grammar, to the way they shape their talk. Listen to
the way people use words not to reveal but to conceal their actions. When
you sense the unspoken, you discover the subtle tactics people take. Listen
deeper yet to the unsayable, to the drives and desires that move beneath
awareness and motivate actions. Listen for strategy, for talk as a social ploy.
Listen to the way one person uses words to cause another person to react in
a way that furthers the speaker’s desires.
    When you put your ear to the wall of society, you soon learn that
although dialogue is far more economical than talk, it’s talk that builds your
vocabulary. Our Internet-driven world forges marvelous new words by the
minute. Terms like “tweet,” “hashtag,” “selfie,” and “narcisstick” (a stick to
lengthen your selfie reach) are inspired by technology. But compound puns
like manspreading (splaying your legs to keep other people from sitting
next to you on the bus), lumbersexual (a fashionably rugged guy),
budtender (a server in a pot shop), and linguisticky (a difficult word) are
born out of the natural love of talk. Listen for such words around you or
make them up yourself, and then put them to work in your storytelling.
    Second, read the good and rewrite the bad. Working writers spend much
of their non-writing time nose-deep in a book. They read novels and plays,
screen and television scripts. They watch and listen to dialogue performed
onstage and onscreen, big and small. They develop an ear for dialogue as a
by-product of all the stories they’ve read and seen, colored by all the living
talk that’s passed through their days.
    Quentin Tarantino’s dialogue strikes a brilliant balance between a
natural sound and high expressivity. No one in reality has ever spoken the
way Tarantino’s characters talk, but audiences believe the patter as if it were
recorded off the street. The imagistic dialogue of Tennessee Williams flows
like wine from a decanter. No one can match novelist Elmore Leonard for
creating high-styled repartee between lowlife characters. The dialogue of
these renowned writers fits the ear like everyday talk, yet at the same time,
expresses authentic characters with unique voices.
    If, on the other hand, you find yourself reading a badly written script or
book, don’t dismiss the writer and toss his pages aside. Go back and rewrite
him. Scratch out his words and insert your own. Rewriting bad dialogue is
the fastest, most efficient way I know to train your talents.
WRITE IN-CHARACTER

Scenes can be imagined from two possible angles: outside in or inside out.
    When an author writes from the outside in, she sits as if in an audience
of one, tenth row center of her characters’ lives, observing her own
imagination at work, watching scenes, overhearing dialogue. Given free
rein to improvise, this technique can generate unlimited variations on every
possible event. The writer sorts through these choices, testing them by trial
and error until she finds an ideal sequence of beats that shapes her scene to
and around its turning point.
    This objective method, open-minded and elastic as it is, risks
superficiality. If the writer always stays on the outside, always imagines her
characters “over there,” her perceptions may shallow out and lose touch
with the emotional currents that run through her characters’ inner lives,
driving them to action, and then from action to talk. As a result, her
dialogue will fall victim to the many flaws of content and form.
    For this reason, a writer also works from the inside out. She places
herself at the center of her character’s being, that irreducible core of
humanity that answers to the name “Me.” From this inner angle, she sees
life through her character’s eyes; she experiences her imaginary events.
    In other words, the writer is the character’s first actor. Writers are
improvisationists who enter all of their characters—man, woman, child,
beast—to shape them from the inside out. She becomes her character, alive
in the now, struggling to get what she wants, emotions and urges surging,
taking action after action against the forces that thwart her desires. She feels
what her character feels, her pulse pounding apace with her character’s
heart. This subjective method of creating dialogue I call writing in-
character.
    To write in-character, use the legendary acting coach Constantin
Stanislavski’s concept of the “Magic If.” Do not ask, “If my character were
in this situation, what would my character do?” because that puts you
outside the role looking in. Do not ask, “If I were in this situation, what
would I do?” because you are not the character. What you might feel, do, or
say in any situation may have little or nothing to do with your character’s
behaviors. Instead, ask: “If I were my character in this situation, what
would I do?” Create out of your own being, but not as yourself, as your
characters.
    In fact, when we look into the background of famous playwrights from
Aristophanes to Shakespeare to Molière to Harold Pinter, we discover that
they all began as actors. Acting, even for prose writers, may be the best
preparation for the writing of dialogue.
    In her biography of her father, Mamie Dickens describes watching her
father, Charles Dickens, at work:

       I was lying on the sofa endeavoring to keep perfectly quiet, while
   my father wrote busily and rapidly at his desk, when he suddenly
   jumped from his chair and rushed to a mirror which hung near, and in
   which I could see the reflection of some extraordinary facial
   contortions which he was making. He returned rapidly to his desk,
   wrote furiously for a few moments, and then went again to the
   mirror. The facial pantomime was resumed, and then turning toward,
   but evidently not seeing, me, he began talking rapidly in a low voice.
   Ceasing this soon, however, he returned once more to his desk,
   where he remained silently writing until luncheon time. It was a most
   curious experience for me, and one of which, I did not until later
   years, fully appreciate the purport. Then I knew that with his natural
   intensity he had thrown himself completely into the character that he
   was creating, and that for the time being he had not only lost sight of
   his surroundings, but had actually became in action, as in
   imagination, the creature of his pen.1

   To encourage your character to speak in a manner true to her nature, do
as Dickens did: act her out. Let her thoughts flood your mind, and then
shape her language in all the contours of vocabulary, grammar, syntax,
diction, trope, phrasing, phonetics, idiom, and pace. Pay close attention to
verbal details and create a one-of-a-kind voice that catches the audience’s
ear and lasts in its memory.
   If, after that, you still find yourself mired in clichés, I have another
suggestion. Turn your computer off and go take improvisation classes. If
you can invent dialogue on your feet in front of a class, you can certainly do
it sitting alone at your desk.
    Once you have created a scene from the inside out, reimagine it from the
outside in. To fully develop your craft, alternate imagining scenes from both
angles. Lastly, sit back as if you were a first-time reader or audience and let
the scene go to work on you.
    Develop your dialogue skill by crafting words as an inner action that
becomes an outer activity, and in those hours when your work flows
smoothly from imagination to page, when you sense the rightness of your
words, do not pause for analysis. Just keep moving. But if your scenes war
with your senses, if confusion stifles creativity, what to do? Ask questions.


KEY QUESTIONS

During the crafting of dialogue, doubts naturally stream through the mind.
For which sense do I write? The eye or the ear? Too much description may
stall into portraiture; too much dialogue may drone into recitations. How
much is too much? Too little?
    Debates over design and purpose: What does this line do for my
character? For the beat? The scene? My story? Like Lady Justice,
blindfolded and poised with a sword in one hand and a scale in the other,
every author weighs the balance of image versus word, of word versus
silence, in every scene she judges.
    Creativity isn’t learning the right answers but asking the strongest
questions. To take your newfound knowledge of scene and dialogue design
into creative practice, I’ve laid out a list of questions to guide your writing
and rewriting into the furthest depths and breadths your talents can reach.
Whenever you are stuck, get back on track by posing the questions below
from each and every character’s point of view. Clear answers will not only
renew momentum but also liberate your talent.
    The answers to the following questions create the subtext that makes
powerful dialogue possible:
    Background desires: What complex of background desires surrounds
the character’s situation in life and his relationships with other characters?
How do the background desires limit and control his choices of action and
his use of language? What actions can he not take, at least not yet? What
words can he not use, at least not yet?
    Objects of desire: What does the character tell himself he wants in
order to restore life’s balance? Looking into the subtext, does he also have a
subconscious desire? If so, how do these two desires contradict each other?
    Super-intention: What need drives the character down his spine of
action? Is it conscious only, or does another desire from his subconscious
mind oppose him? Is he his own worst enemy?
    Scene intentions: At this moment, what is the character’s scene
intention? What does he seem to want? For complex, multidimensional
characters, also ask: What does he really want? What is his subconscious
scene intention? Is his scene intention a step in his pursuit of his super-
intention? In other words, does this scene make sense in light of the overall
story arc?
    Motivation: Why does this character want what he wants?
    Scene driver: Who drives this scene and makes it happen?
    Forces of antagonism: What are the sources of conflict in the scene?
Do they come from within the character? Other characters? The setting?
    Scene value(s): What value(s) is at stake in the character’s life in this
scene? What is the opening charge of the value(s)? The closing charge of
value(s)?
    Subtext: Beneath what the character seems to be doing, what is he
actually doing? What tactics might the character use to pursue his scene
intention?
    Beats: What specific action does the character take in the subtext of
each line? What reactions might these actions cause? On which side of the
beat does this line play? Is it an action or a reaction?
    Progression: How do the beats progress my scene? Do they
progressively top each other?
    Tactics: With these words, said in this way, what specific tactic is the
character taking? What effect is he trying to cause?
    Turning point: How does the scene’s value(s) move in a
positive/negative dynamic? Where is the scene’s turning point? In what
precise beat of behavior does the value(s) change to the final charge?
    Deep character: How do the choices of action in this scene reveal the
truth about my characters?
    Scene progression: How does this scene progress my story?
   These questions guide the final step:
   Text: Outwardly, what would my character say in order to get what he
wants? What words and phrases might the character use to help him carry
out his tactics, actions, and reactions?
   Exposition: What facts of history, society, and biography does this line
contain? Are they dramatized invisibly or narratized explicitly? Do they
come in too soon, too late, or at just the right moment?
   Characterization: Do the characters’ verbal styles match their
particular personalities, backgrounds, and traits of characterization?
   Ask and answer these questions on every beat. When in the middle of
writing the scene’s dialogue, ask and answer these questions again. After
you’ve written the scene, ask and answer these questions for a third time.
The best questions create the best answers.


LAST WORDS

The technique of writing in-character may, at first, seem daunting. But
instinctively you’ve done this all your life. After every confrontation you’ve
ever had with another person, what have you done? You’ve rerun the scene
through your imagination, re-creating it and rewriting it the way it should
have gone down. You’ve put yourself inside your own head and the head of
your antagonist, and then imaginatively reinvented the conflict beat by beat.
And I’ll bet that your rewrites of life are always vivid, always effective. To
write dialogue, you essentially do the same thing you do when you rewrite
life.
    To create character-specific dialogue, you need to gather knowledge of
human behavior through close observations of people around you and
through reading both fiction and nonfiction. On the balance, however, the
source of all fine character writing is rooted in self-knowledge. As Anton
Chekhov said: “Everything I know about human nature I learned from me.”
    Ultimately, you find your characters in yourself; you find their words in
your imagination. Ask the Magic If: “If I were this character in these
circumstances, what would I do? What would I say?” Then listen for the
honest answer, for it is always correct. You would do and say the human
thing.
   The more you penetrate the mysteries of your own humanity, the more
you’re able to understand the humanity of others and the unique ways they
express it. As your self-awareness grows, you will discover you can be
many people. You can create them, act them, and speak in their voices.
   “Here’s looking at you, kid.”
