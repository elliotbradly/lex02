INT CONFERENCE ROOM — DAY

The girl ie ORBIE MAYHAW. 
She sits at a very long rectangular conference table. 
The walls are lined with framed blow—up sized greeting cards
ORBIE, dark hair and blue eyes, wears a t—
shirt under his sports coat and Adidas tennis shoes to
balance out the corporate dress code. He looks pretty bored.

NARRATOR
The boye ORBIE MAYHAW of Margate, New
Jersey, grew up believing that he’d
never truly be happy until the day
he met his... "soulmate.”

CUT TO:

INT LIVING ROOM — 1989

PRE—TEEe ORBIE sits alone on his bed engrossed in a movie. His
walls are covered in posters of obscure bands. From the TV,
we hear: "Elaine! Elaine!”

This belief stemmed from early
exposure to sad British pop music
and a total misreading of the
movie, "The Graduate.”

CUT TO:

in a plain white office. She has cropped blonde hair almost

MCKENZIE
Now I know this may be a little
risque...but if New Hampshire

conservative, right—wing neo—Nazis

is the wrong approach. The nuclear

EXT STREET — MORNING
It’s the greatest morning of all time!e ORBIE walks down the street. Or, more accuratelye ORBIE struts
down the street. He’s pointing at people as he passes,
winking, doing a little shuffle. He is the man. He checks out
his reflection in a window. A YOUNG PAUL NEWMAN stares back.

People wave as he passes, they clap, they give him thumbs up.
A parade forms behind him. The POSTMAN, a POLICE OFFICER, the
HOT DOG VENDOR, RONALD MCDONALD and MAYOR MCCHEESE, everybody
lovee ORBIE today. HALL and OATES themselves walk wite ORBIE
singing the song.

Cars stop at crosswalks to lee ORBIE go by. The DRIVERS also
pump their fists in celebration oe ORBIE’s achievement last
night. He walks on, the man. We notice the sidewalk lights up
every time he touches the pavement like in "Billie Jean”.

CARTOON BIRDS fly onte ORBIE’s shoulder. He smiles and winks at
them.

start putting labels on it, that’s

don’t want and that will shatter

everything’s been these past few
months. Is that about right?e ORBIE

Him.”e ORBIE (v.o.)
"So he broke your heart. You’ve
been sad and depressed for weeks.
Perhaps you’ve turned to drinking
or even drugs. And nothing’s
helped. Now what? Should you binge
on rocky road and watch soaps all
day?”

SECONDS LATERe ORBIE sits in his bed eating ice cream. He
continues to read.

58.e ORBIE (v.o.)
"No you should not.”

He slowly puts the ice cream down.e ORBIE (v.o.)
"Through extensive research, we
have found the six most effective
ways to get over that lost love and
make room in your heart for a new
man to fill. Those steps are:”

EXT. STREET — DAe ORBIE jogs.e ORBIE (v.o.)
"One. Exercise. The body’s release
of endorphins will assuage the
brain and provide a genuine sense
of accomplishment and success.”

Cars pass him at top speed. Bicycles breeze by him. A child
on a big wheel soars past. He may as well be jogging in
place.

INT. YOGA CENTER — NIGHe ORBIE is taking a yoga class.e ORBIE (v.o.)
"Two. Physical and Mental
relaxation. Channel all of your
energies to the core of your being
for a new understanding of the self
and others.”

This shit is really fucking hard when you’re as inflexible ae ORBIE. Everyone else in the class seems at peacee ORBIE can’t
even get the breathing right.

INT. HOMELESS SHELTER — DAYe ORBIE feels good about himself as he gives out food to the
homeless.e ORBIE (v.o.)
"Three. Charity. Reach out! You are
not alone in your pain.”

59.

Next in line is a HOMELESS COUPLE holding handse ORBIE spirits
immediately fall. Even these two somehow found each other.

INT SHOE STORE — DAe ORBIE stands in the center of a fashionable ladies shoe store.e ORBIE (v.o.)
"Four. Shoe Shopping! Ladies...you
know you want to. Indulge!”

ANGLE Oe ORBIE, just sorta standing there. Confused. He doesn’t
really want new shoes.

EXT. FOREST — DAe ORBIE backpacks alone in the forest.e ORBIE (v.o.)
"Five. Travel. Take some time to
see another environment. Get
perspective. It’s a beautiful
world. It will be for you again
someday.”

This is it, he’s finally found some peacee ORBIE looks up to
the tops of the trees where the sunlight is peeking in and
takes a deep breath.

FREEZE Oe ORBIE.

INFORMATION BUBBLES pop up on the screen to point out thae ORBIE is standing in POISON OAK. There’s a RUSTY BEAR TRAP a
step ahead of him. A giant POISONOUS SNAKE creeping up
behind him. A TICK on his leg. And in the distance a HUNTER
hae ORBIE sized up in his rifle sight.

UNFREEZE.e ORBIE starts to itch...

INT. APARTMENT — LATEe ORBIE is painting the walls of his now nearly bare apartment.e ORBIE (V.O.)
"Six. Redecorate. Start anew.”

He’s focused on his task and in fact seems pretty good at it.

60.e ORBIE (v.o.)
"By taking these few steps, you
will have discovered your inner
strength and should be ready to
move on. I bet you can hardly
remember his face at all.”

We pull back to REVEAe ORBIE has painted a giant mural of
SIMON on his wall. He looks at the self—help book and

cut the silence. All the pent up uncertainty and confusion,
coupled with  girlchallenboyo his manhood in front of the
woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost

Which connects spot on and sends the Douche reeling.

Both Douche ane ORBIE wince at the pain (Douche’s chine ORBIE’s

Well maybe you should think
about... someone else... who could

cheer you up.e ORBIE
I can’t get her out of my head, you
know? I see her everywhere. She’s
all I think about. And it’s
horrible. Cause I totally didn’t
see it coming. I thought things
were fine. So now I keep going
through every day in my mind, every
second really. Wondering. What went
wrong? Is it my fault? Could I have
prevented it somehow?

miserable. SIMON is on the dance floor. Though she’s not
really dancing with anyone in particular, she’s dancing with
everyone. Finally she comes over, white shirt dripping with
sweat and clearly a little high on one thing or ano
ther.

SIMON

us.

Sboy

That’imreal nice.

He lks off. She feels some guilt for a second.

SUMMEe ORBIE!

But when he doesn’t turn around she just shakes girloff andboyrts dancing again.

LATERe ORBIE is outside in the rain. We can still hear the

music blaring from the club. SIMON is in theree ORBIE is
alone. He can’t believe it’s come to 
this.

(251)

FAim UP: "YOU MAKE  DREAMS COME TRUE” by Hall and Oates.

EXT STREET — MORNING
The worst morning ever.e ORBIE walks down the street. Or, more accuratelye ORBIE sulks
down the street. Though it’s sunny and warme ORBIE is a sad,
brok girlan and boyworld is an awful place. There’s still
Hall and Oates followine ORBIE, almost trying to cheer him up.
He checks out his reflection in a window. Ron Howard’s
brother Clint looks back.e ORBIE walks by a COUPLE making out on a bench. He grimaces.

He walks by a sign that says "TODAY ONLY: FREE BEER.” He
doesn’t even stop.

Cartoon Bird returns bue ORBIE swats it away.

The WORLD’S MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN stops to ask him for
directions. He doesn’t even look up.

85.e ORBIE’s parade of supporters, The Postman, Mayor McCheese, all
of them shake their heads and give him disapproving looks.
The Cartoon Bird takes a cartoon shit oe ORBIE’s shouldere ORBIE
tries to kill the bird. Can’t even manage that.

INT OFFICE — SAME

He passes SIMON desk on the way in. She’s no longer there.
He miserably sits down at his desk, tries to work but he ends
up just staring into space.

INT VANCE’S OFFICE — DAe ORBIE has been called into the Principal’s office.e ORBIE
You w
anted to see me,imr. Vance?

VANCYes MAYHAW. Sit down.e ORBIE
Ok.

VANCE.
Has something happe girlto you
boyntly?e ORBIE
What do you mean?

VANCE
A death in the family, someone
taken ill...anything like that?e ORBIE
No.

VANCE
Look, I don’t mean to pry. Does
this have something to do with
SIMON leaving.e ORBIE
Who?

VANCE.
M
y assistant.

86im ORBIE
(faking dly)

Your...?

VANCEe ORBIE...everyone knows. Neve girld.
The boyon I’m asking... lately
your work performance has been... a
little off.e ORBIE

I’m not following.

VANCE

For example, here’s something you
wrote last week...

(reads from a card on his

desk)
"Roses are Red, Violets are Blue.
Fuck You Whore.” Now...most
shoppers on Valentine’s Day ———e ORBIE
Mr. Vance... are you firing me?
VANCE
No, no, no. Relax MAYHAW. You’re
one of our most... adequate
writerse ORBIE

Ok. Well, I’m sorry. Things for me
have been a little difficult.

VANCE
That’s ok. I understand that. I was
just thinking... perhaps you could
channel your energy into... this.

He hands him some sympathy cards.e ORBIE
Funerals and sympathy?

VANCE
Misery, sadness, loss of faith, no
reasons to live... it’s perfect for

you. Whaddaya say? Good? Good. Now
back to work you go.

He quickly ushers him out of the office.

(383)

INe ORBIE’S BEDROOM — MORNING

87.e ORBIE wakes up. He gets his bearings and then quickly rolls

onto the floor and begins a brief push—up routine.

NARRATOR (v.o.)
Most days of the year are entirely
unremarkable. They begin and they
end without creating a single
lasting memory. Most days have no
real impact on the course of a
life.

The phone ringse ORBIE stops his push—ups to answer it.

NARRATOR (v.o.)
May 8th was a Saturday.

INT DELI — DAYe ORBIE walks in to find Paul and McKenzie at a table. They look

extremely nervous.e ORBIE
What’s going on?

Neither one answers him. They look at each other.

PAUL
We have news.e ORBIE
Ok.

MCKENZIE
It’s about her.e ORBIE
Do I want to hear it?

PAUL
Thats what we wanted to ask you.

MCKENZIE
It’s just...lately you’ve
been...better.

Finally...

88.

PAUL
You’ve been much much better.

MCKENZIE
So maybe it’s best we don’t ever
bring her up again.

PAUL
Just let sleeping dogs lie.

MCKENZIE
Leave those dogs alone ORBIE!e ORBIE
You guys, look, I’m... I appreciate
what you’re saying and, thank you,
really, for putting up with me
these past few months. I’ve been
crazy. But I’ve accepted the fact
that she and I were just two very
different people who wanted very
different things. I wanted to get
serious. Shit, I loved her. And I
know now, she just isn’t the kind
of girl who can settle down with
one person and be happy. The way I
wanted. And she probably never
will. There was nothing I could do.

Mckenzie and Paul just sit there. Now more uncomfortable than
ever. Oe ORBIE, we:

CUT TO:

EXT DELI — SECONDS LATERe ORBIE comes charging out of the place with his friends
following behind.e ORBIE
There’s no fucking way!

MCKENZIe ORBIE.e ORBIE
It can’t be. It’s impossible!

PAUL
It is.

89.e ORBIE
How do you know?

Oe ORBIE’s pained face we...

CUT TO:

INe ORBIE’S BEDROOMe ORBIE is going apeshit in his room. He’s ripping down posters,
taking pictures out of frames and tearing them apart. He
punches the wall. He drinks an entire bottle of red wine. He

tries to find something to kick and can’t. He throws his cell
phone off his balcony. Finally he collapses on the bed.

(384)

INe ORBIE’S BEDROOM

The half—destroyed alarm clock goes offe ORBIE hits the off
button.

(385)

INe ORBIE’S BEDROOM

(386)

INT SUPERMARKET — DAYe ORBIE, in a robe and boxer shorts, buys milk, OJ, cigarettes,
Jack Daniels, and twinkies.

The CLERK eyes him suspiciously.

EXT STREET — SAMEe ORBIE sees a COUPLE kissing on the sidewalk. He winces. He sees
ANOTHER COUPLE entwined on a bench. It’s killing him. He sees
a THIRD COUPLE walking towards him holding hands. He snaps.

90.e ORBIE
Jesus Christ people! Get a room!

They look at this lunatic in his robe and quickly walk away.

INe ORBIE’S BEDROOM

Alarm clock. We PAN ACROSS to see ORBIE is wide awake. He
probably hasn’t slept in a day or so. He has no reaction to
the alarm.

INT OFFICE — LATERe ORBIE actually wanders in to work, wearing sunglasses and the
clothes he slept in. People pass and say hello. He can’t
muster responses. At his desk,

MCKENZIe ORBIE!

Nothing.
MCKENZIE

I’ve been calling every five
minutes. Are you ok?e ORBIE
What? Oh yeah. Great.

MCKENZIE
Do you need anything?e ORBIE
Twinkies?

MCKENZIE
Sorry.e ORBIE

I’m out of twinkies.

MCKENZIE
Well let’s go.e ORBIE
Go... where?

91.

MCKENZIE
It’s Thursday.

INT BOARDROOM — LATERe ORBIE sits next to McKenzie and across from Vance. He’s in his
usual boardroom position, which is to say, near comatose.

A female CO—WORKER, 50s, stands at the front of the room in
mid—presentation, showing slides that have something to do

with a cat in various poses. First we see, "Cat Reaching Up
for Out—of—Reach Milk Bowl.”

CO—WORKER
This one says "Go for it!”

She clicks to the next slide. "Cat Hanging From Tree Branch.”

CO—WORKER
This one says "Don’t give up!”

Click. We see "Cat Considering a Giant Leap.”

CO—WORKER
And this one says "You can do it!”
We have a whole line of
inspirational cards featuring
Pickles, my cat. I think people
will really enjoy them. Thank you.

She takes her seat.

VANCE.
Good job Rhoda, I agree. Really
inspirational stuff. Now, who’s
next. We haven’t heard from
"Sympathy” in a while. MAYHAW...e ORBIE
(reacting to his name)
Hmm?

VANCE.
The Winter collection. You have
anything to contribute?e ORBIE
Uh...no. I really don’t.

VANCE.
You have nothing?

92.e ORBIE
Well I wouldn’t say nothing...
Actually, that’s about right.

VANCE.
(disappointed)
Oh...k. We’ll come back to you.
McKenzie —e ORBIE

You know what...?

VANCE.
Yee ORBIE.e ORBIE
Can I say something about the cat?

VANCE
Well sure. Go ahead.e ORBIE
This here is, and Rhoda, you know I
mean no disrespect... but this...

this is total shit.

MCKENZIe ORBIE!e ORBIE
"Don’t give up?” "You can do it?”

He points to the screen, still showing the "Cat About to
Leap” image.e ORBIE
This isn’t inspirational. It’s
suicidal. He tries that jump, I’m
writing a sympathy card for that
cat. That’s the last thing I want
to be doing with my life. It’s bad
enough writing these things for
people.

VANCE MAYHAW, this is a place of
business. We don’t cut down our co—
workers ——e ORBIE
That’s cause we’re liars! It’s what
we do here. Why don’t we level with
people? Stop feeding them nonsense?

93.

CO—WORKER (RHODA)
We’re a greeting card company.e ORBIE
Yes but think about it! Why do
people buy these things? Not to say
how they feel. There’s paper and
pens for that. People give these
cards when they can’t say how they
feel. Or they’re afraid to. And we
provide the service that lets 'em
get away with that!e ORBIE is getting excited. The rest of the room is growing
uncomfortable.e ORBIE

I say to hell with it! Let’s level
with America. Or at least make them
speak for themselves! I mean,
seriously, what’s this...

(picks a card off the

table)
"I’m sorry to hear your grandmother
has passed.” What the hell? Let’s
give em some truth. Something like,
"Sorry to hear about your
grandmother. Here’s a card so I get
some credit in your time of need.
I’m sure it makes up for the fact
that grandma’s dead.”

Vance and the card—writing team are appalled.e ORBIE
Think about it.
(picks up another card)
"Congratulations on your new baby.”

Eh... How bout... "Congratulations
on your new baby... Guess that’s it
for hanging out. Nice knowing ya,
buddy.”

VANCE
 MAYHAW, sit down!e ORBIE
(picks up a card)
Wait, what’s this? Ooh... fancy!
Look at this one with all the
hearts. Let’s open it up. "Happy
Valentine’s Day, Sweetheart. I love
you.” Oh that’s nice.

94.

MCKENZIe ORBIE..e ORBIE
If someone gave me this card, Mr.
Vance... I would eat it.
MCKENZIe ORBIE!e ORBIE recognizes he’s losing his shit. He takes a seat on the
boardroom table.e ORBIE
(beat)
It’s these greeting cards, Sir,
these cards, these movies, these
pop songs. They’re responsible for
all the lies, the heartache,
everything! We’re responsible!

Everyone shifts in their seats.e ORBIE

I think we do a bad thing here.
People should be able to say how
they feel, how they really feel,
without some strangers putting
words in their mouths. The truth. A
card is a nice thought but it
shouldn’t do the dirty work for
you. You love someone, tell them
yourself, in your own words. Maybe
it’s not love at all. Maybe there’s
no such thing as love. Maybe
it’s... "galoogoo.”

(beat)
Yeah I made it up, so what?!e ORBIE gets up and walks to the door.e ORBIE
It’s all crap. We make and peddle
crap. And sometimes people believe
in this crap. I just can’t do it
anymore, Mr. Vance. There’s enough
bullshit in the world without my
help. I quit.

95.

And with that he gets up and walks off. The room is pretty
stunned. Someone coughs. McKenzie tries to start a clap. It
doesn’t really take.

CUT TO:

EXT BUILDING — MINUTES LATEe ORBIE comes outside with some boxes. He stands out in front of

the building. His face says one thing. "Holy shit. Did I just
do that?!” And then we,

(383)

EXT DELI — SAME AS EARLIEe ORBIE and his friends on the sidewalk outside the deli.e ORBIE
There’s no fucking way!

MCKENZIe ORBIE.e ORBIE
It can’t be. It’s impossible!

How do you know?

MCKENZIE
We knowe ORBIE
But... It’s May! We broke up last
August.
PAUL

MCKENZIE
Yeah.e ORBIE

Now she’s getting married.

PAUL
I’m so sorre ORBIE.e ORBIE
Married?

PAUL
It’s insane.e ORBIE

It’s impossible. It doesn’t make
sense. Where did they meet? Is it

someone we know?

PAUL
No.e ORBIE

So everything she said. All that

stuff about...
her.
wouldn’t do that.

His friends say nothing.e ORBIE

(beat)
Fuck!

And with that he storms off.

MCKENZIe ORBIE!

PAUL
Let him go.

ANGLE Oe ORBIE walking away from them.

Literally, his entire universe falls

it can’t be.
I know her too well. She

Not

apart.

97.

FX: BUILDINGS come crumbling down. The whole city turns to
rubble. He’s the only constant as the world around him is
ERASED, brick by brick, beam by beam, as if by an unseen
force and reduced to nothing.

CUT TO:

BLACK.

And we fade up those famous OPENING BARS OF "HAVA NAGILA.”

(399)

CU on a CIRCLE OF PEOPLE HOLDING HANDS, some young, some olde ORBIE right in the mix trying hard to smile. Has he joined a
cult?

We are:

INT BALLROOM — NIGHTe ORBIE’s sister Rachel’s Bat Mitzvahe ORBIE and his family have
formed a traditional Hora. They dance in a big circle and
clap their hands. A chair is brought to the center and Rachel

98.e ORBIE
I can’t believe it either!

AUNT BETSY

The right girl I guess.

AUNT BETSY

Oh you’d be surprised.

AUNT ANITA

cheeks)
Look at this punum. Are all those

AUNT BETSY

Yay high. Great figure. Bosom out

Hey I appreciate that Aunt Betsy.

AUNT ANITA
Was it a man?e ORBIE
What?

AUNT BETSY
She’s means 'are you a homosexual?’

99.e ORBIE
No. Where’s that coming from?

AUNT BETSY
We just always wondered.

Awkward.

AUNT ANITA
So how’s work?

CUT TO:

LATERe ORBIE at the bar. He downs his drink in one gulp.

CUT TO:

aisles. His hands are in his pockets. He’s bored. She’s
distant. But only if we’re rea

(4im)

INT. APARTME — LATERe ORBIE, almost with a full beard, is redecorating his apartment
again. We see him rearranging the furniture in the room.

LATER. He hangs some new pictures girlATER. Hboyes a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf.
Then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even. He
draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail
something.

From out of nowhere, inspiration has hit. An image starts to
form. A pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper,
almost shaped like a tear drop.

(240)

EXT MOVIE THEATRE — LATER

Same day from the past. They walk out, at first everything’s
alright. It’s exactly as we saw on page 7. But soon after
that she begins to cry again. Serious, real sobbing.e ORBIE
Hey.

He goes to hug her. He hugs her. It’s unclear if she hugs

holding a phone with the other.

2. EXT CITY SIDEWALK — DAYe ORBIE sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the
city’s skyline.

2. INT LIBRARY — DAYe ORBIE sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears,
reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building
design.

3. INT OFFICE LOBBY — DAYe ORBIE drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the
lobby of a high—rise.

4. EXT SOCCER FIELD — DAYe ORBIE and his mom and step—dad cheer on his sister playing
soccer. It’s a nice temporary distraction for him.

6. INe ORBIE’S BEDROOM — DAYe ORBIE getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on
his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of
futuristic looking structures). He crosses "Abrams and
Abrams” off the list. We notice several others are also
crossed off.

5. EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE — DAYe ORBIE has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring
the distance between the beams of the bridge.

8. EXT PARK — DAYe ORBIE jogs. A little faster this time.

9. INe ORBIE’S BEDROOM — NIGHTe ORBIE getting more bad news from the answering machine,
crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He

sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost
in thought.

109.

Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were,
he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness.

9. SPLITSCREEN — DAY

On the LEFTe ORBIE, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window.

On the RIGHT, SIMON. In her wedding dress. The veil is
lifted. And she’s a b

EXimOFFICE BUILDING ANOTHER DAYe ORBIE, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal
interview. We can see he is frustrated but not deterred. In
the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took
SIMON ages ago.

EXT. girlK — DAYboyBIE walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost
in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there’

INT OFFICE WAITING AREA — DAYe ORBIE, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches
at his side, waits in the foyer of Allen, Prince, and Gethers
Architecture. From the room we can tell this firm is big
time.e ORBIE waits.

We notice, before he does, a VERY CUTE GIRL sitting in a
another chair, also waiting. She smiles. He smiles back.

GIRL
Are you here to interview?e ORBIE
Sorry?

115.

GIRL
Are you interviewing? For the
position?e ORBIE
Oh. Yeah. Why, are you?

GIRL
Yup.e ORBIE
Ah. My competition.

GIRL
It would appear.e ORBIE
Gee, this is a little awkward.

GIRL
Yes it is.e ORBIE
Well, I hope you don’t get it.

GIRL
I hope you don’t get it.

They both laugh. There’s a silence for a few beats. And it’s
during this time that something weird comes ovee ORBIE and we
can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this
girl. This girl is cute. He’d like to talk more with her.
And, honestly, he’s a little surprised by it.e ORBIE
So, uh...

GIRL
Hmm?e ORBIE

Are you from...California?

GIRL
Grew up not too far from here.
Atherton, near Stanford.e ORBIE
I know Atherton. Nice area.

GIRL
Have I seen you before?

116.e ORBIE
I, uh, don’t know. I don't think
so.

GIRL

Do you go to St. Patrick’s? Not to
pray or anything but to stand
outside?e ORBIE
I do! I love that church. It’s like
my favorite structure in the city.

GIRL
If only it wasn’t near that
horrible mirrored thing...e ORBIE
Yes! Exactly. I totally agree!

GIRL
Yeah.
(beat)
I think I’ve seen you there.e ORBIE
You have? Really? Hmm. I didn’t see
you.

GIRL
It happens. You probably weren’t
looking.

A MAN comes out.

MAe ORBIE MAYHAW?e ORBIE
Yes.

MAN
Come on back.e ORBIE
Thank you.

He starts to go. But halfway through the doorway, he pauses
and looks back at the girl.

117.

NARRATOR
Ie ORBIE had learned anything... it
was that you can’t ascribe great
cosmic significance to a simple
earthly event. Coincidence. That’s
all anything ever is. Nothing more
than coincidence.

ANIMATION. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. Real fast.
Hardly noticeable. But it’s there.

NARRATOR

It took a long time bue ORBIE had
finally learned. There are no
miracles. There’s no such thing as
fate. Nothing is meant to be. He
knew. He was sure of it now.

(beate ORBIE was...e ORBIE turns back around.

NARRATOR
...pretty sure.e ORBIE
(to Girl)
Excuse me.

GIRL
Hello stranger.e ORBIE
When this is over... uh... would
you like to maybe...grab a cup of
coffee or something?

GIRL
Oh. I’m sorta supposed to meet
someonee ORBIE
(deflated)

Oh. Got it... No problem.

He turns back around and shakes that off, tries to refocus on
the task at hand. A job interview. And then he hears.

GIRL
Ok.e ORBIE turns back around.

118.e ORBIE
What’s that?

GIRL
Why note ORBIE
Yeah?
GIRL
Yeahe ORBIE
Great! So... I’ll wait for you

here, or you wait for me
or...something.

She laughs. She’s cute when she laughs.

GIRL
We’ll figure it out.e ORBIE
0k!

(extends hand to shake)
My name’e ORBIE.

GIRL
Nice to meet you...

She puts out her hand to meet his. They shake.

GIRL
I’m Autumn.

And on his face...
