of remaining together on the

spouses needs a higher level of
care, either temporarily or per-
manently. For the person who
lives alone, the benefit of having
people around and not feeling isolated is enormous. The deci-
sion to move into a CCRC reduces the burden of how older
adults will meet their future health service needs and may pro-
tect their assets from the escalating costs of long-term care.
Many people have found peace of mind in making this decision.

When residents move to a CCRC they pay a significant en-
trance fee and a monthly service fee. These costs vary accord-
ing to the type of housing selected, size of the living unit,
whether there will be one or two people occupying the living
space, and the type of contract selected. The monthly fees may
include meals, housekeeping services, a fitness center, and
other services and amenities. They are likely to increase at an

Organization History and Structure

CCRCs have different organizational structures. Although
most CCRCs are non-profit,
today there are a growing
number of for-profit organi-
zations with their own invest-
ment and operating proce-
dures. At least one CCRC
has two facilities in the state,
and some own facilities in
other states. Understanding
this is important for two rea-
sons. First, whatever the
structure there are financial
implications. Secondly, un-
derstand where headquarter decisions are made, and policies
are formulated, and the process whereby residents can have a
voice.

                        ask, which are discussed in the section on financial aspects.

                        Facility and Grounds
                        When you visit a CCRC and the marketing department takes
                        you on a tour of the buildings, ask to see the grounds as well.
                        See all you can, inside and outside, and ask lots of questions.
                        Both your living unit and the common areas will be your home
                        if you decide to move to a CCRC. Not all the items listed below
                        may be important to you. Here are a few things to observe and
                        inquire about:

                        • How well is the exterior of the facility being maintained?
                        • What is the condition of the grounds, landscaping, etc.?
                        • Are there areas where residents may do some gardening?
                        • Is there a greenhouse?

Types of Housing Units
The marketing department will show you a variety of living
units that they feel will meet your needs. Make sure you look
at the location in relation to where other activities occur.
Some people prefer to be close to the dining room and com-
mon areas; others like to have more privacy even if the walk
is a little longer. If the campus has cottages that are farther
from the main area, residents may have to walk to the main
building for dining and other activities.

You might not move again so it is important for you to find a
living space you enjoy and that does not encumber you. Be
sure to ask what changes you may make in your living unit.
It is easier to take care of these things before the move. Usu-
ally the CCRC organization will repaint, re-carpet, and in-
stall new appliances as needed. There may be a cost to up-
grade from standard selections.

Below is a list to consider:

• Is there a choice of carpets, kitchen flooring, and paint col-
  ors? Cost?
• Check the condition of the cabinets. Do they need to be re-
  placed?
• Is there a microwave?
• Cable TV, internet access, WiFi?
• Washer and dryer: in living units or shared?
• Housekeeping: how often? Included in monthly fee?
• Can you build in more shelves, bookcases if you need
  them?

                                            ing than being in active and noisy environs.
                                            Most people who move into CCRCs celebrate
                                            the warmth of the people as one of the best
                                            benefits of the move. It is important to check
                         out the communities you are considering.

                         We recommend you pay several visits to the communities that
                         interest you. When you visit, do not just talk to the marketing
                         people: ask to meet residents as well.

                         Most CCRCs have guest rooms where you can spend one or
                         two nights. Marketing can arrange for you to have some meals
                         in the dining room with residents who may have similar inter-
                         ests and who may share your political and social values. This
                         can provide a wonderful opportunity to find out what residents
                         appreciate about the community, what activities they enjoy and
                         why they decided to come. It is also an opportunity to experi-
                         ence the meal service.

forts, a block association, apartment or condo association, or
local government may enjoy becoming involved in this new
community. Joining the association helps new residents get to
know people and use their experience and skills. In addition to
council-related groups, all the CCRCs have other activities,
often started by residents, such as a book club, bridge group,
poker, quilting or creative writing group, which are worth ex-
ploring.

                        What Kinds of Ownership Are There?
                        Most CCRCs are owned by not-for-profit sponsors while the rest
                        are owned by for-profit companies. This latter form has been in-
                        creasing in recent years.

                        What Are the Different Types of Contracts That You
                        May Encounter?
                        A CCRC contract is a financial investment and your
                        money may be at risk. Take the time to become con-
                        versant with the important financial provisions and
                        terms in the contract offered to you. Consult an attor-
                        ney or other professional experienced in matters relating to an in-
                        vestment in a CCRC.

                        Costs associated with residing at a CCRC vary by type of contract.
                        There are three types of CCRC contracts, namely:

                             Type A: All-Inclusive Contract – involves entry fees and a
                        standard monthly service fee for all levels of care for life, includ-
                        ing independent living, assisted living, and nursing care.

                             Type B: Modified Contract – involves entry fees and
                        monthly service fees with a guarantee of access to higher levels of
                        care, usually at a reduced rate or for a set period of time before
                        market rates come into play.

                           Type C: Fee-for-Service Contract – involves entry fees and

Most contracts do not make the resident an owner of any of the real
estate or facility. A contract that provides only housing on a rental
basis is not a CCRC.

Connecticut legislation permits CCRCs to provide a program of
coordinated long-term care, which helps healthy, active seniors to
stay in their homes as they age and their health needs change. De-
signed to meet future health care needs either in one’s home or on a
CCRC campus, members usually pay a one-time entry fee and a
monthly fee that basically remains the same over one’s lifetime.
These programs may be available in some communities.

                                          In order to carry out its responsibility, the DSS
                                          requires the owner or provider to submit a com-

                        should be provided with a copy of the latest such statement. Your

                        What Should I Look for in the Disclosure Statement?
                        The Disclosure Statement is the most important document that you
                        can obtain before committing to residency in a CCRC. The content
                        of this Statement is specified by the DSS in the Connecticut Stat-

Questions you should ask are:

•   What is the present monthly fee and what has it been over the
    past five years?
•   What should I expect in the way of increases in the monthly
    service fee in the next five years?
•   What is the percentage of occupancy in the independent living
    units now, what has it been for the previous five years, and
    what is it expected to be in the next five years?
•   Does the facility operate within its means or does it incur a
    deficit?
•   If it has been incurring deficits, what steps have been taken to
    avoid that result in the future?
•   Does the owning enterprise have sufficient cash and other cur-
    rent assets to meet all current liabilities?
•   If not, will the owning enterprise overcome this insolvency
    condition in the coming year?
•   What is the level of debt service the owning enterprise has to
    pay and what portion of the monthly service fee does it repre-
    sent?
•   When does the existing debt have to be repaid?
•   If refinancing is required shortly, what steps have been taken to
    achieve this goal and how successful have they been?

It is likely John and Mary can afford the entry fee and
monthly service costs at their chosen CCRC. However,
they need to anticipate inflation and other increases in
living costs as they grow older, perhaps including higher
health care expenses. To place this point in perspective,
assume they actually make monthly withdrawals of
$4,000 from the date of CCRC residency. In this event,
the couple would deplete their assets in about 12 years.

                      much attention at the expense of an equal

respect, make sure the CCRC you choose is right for you today
and for all the tomorrows to come.

The Connecticut Continuing Care Residents Association (ConnCCRA) would like to ac-
knowledge the contributions by this publication’s principal authors: President Daniel D.
Robinson, Meadow Ridge; Vice President Joseph H. Walton, Seabury; former President Bil-
lie T. Alban, Seabury; and editor-in-chief Cecilia Malin, Ashlar Village. Through participa-
tion in the affairs of local communities and active involvement in state and national resident
associations, this team has long supported the rights of CCRC residents and promoted
causes that enrich life for seniors.

ConnCCRA would like to acknowledge the contributions of Mag Morelli, President-
LeadingAge Connecticut, her staff, the Presidents of ConnCCRA Residents Associations,
their community residents, Connecticut CCRC Chief Executive Officers, and their staff
members. Their expertise, knowledge, and willingness to share has been invaluable
throughout the drafting and editing of this Consumer Guide for selecting a life care commu-
nity in Connecticut.

A special thanks to The Commission on Aging of the Town of Greenwich for providing
support that made publication of this Consumer Guide possible.

ConnCCRA is the only independent CCRC residents’ organization addressing statewide
policy and legislative issues. For more than a decade ConnCCRA has supported initiatives
to bolster the rights and protection of CCRC residents.
