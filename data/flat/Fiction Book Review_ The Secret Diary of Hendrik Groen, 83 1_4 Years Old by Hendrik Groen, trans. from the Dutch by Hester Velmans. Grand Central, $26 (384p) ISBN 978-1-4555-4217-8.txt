                                          within a nursing home in Amsterdam. Bored with the
                                          daily monotony of life at the center, he decides to
                                          keep a journal for a complete year to expose the
                                          frustrations, gripes, and groans of his fellow                The Talented Miss Farwell

                                          “inmates” and the realities of growing old. Between
                                          hilarious quips about life, Hendrik regales readers
                                          with the joys of the motor scooter and his decision to
                                          relent and wear adult diapers. Hendrik’s good friend
                                          Evert—a crotchety old fellow who gets his kicks riling
                                          up the other residents—helps stave off the loneliness,
                                          but it’s when new resident Eefje arrives that Hendrik
                                          feels a spark he hasn’t experienced in a long time.
                                          Hendrik, Eefje, and Evert, along with a small group of
                                          wily seniors, decide to have a little fun while they still
                                          can by organizing the Old-But-Not-Dead Club to plan
                                          outings and excursions, including tai chi and cooking
                                          classes, and visits to the casino and museums.                                    ADVERTISEMENT

                                          Engaging and hilarious, Hendrik’s diary gives a
                                          dignity and respect to the elderly often overlooked in
                                          popular culture, providing readers a look into the
                                          importance of friendship and the realities of the
                                          senior care system in modern society. (July)
