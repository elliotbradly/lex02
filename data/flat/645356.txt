This book comes out of a collaborative friendship that emerged through mutual
interests in how the humanities could re-think old age, especially its stigma-
tizing association with nursing homes. On separate continents, we had been
reading and writing about the same novels and films with similar goals in
mind. Coming together to ask questions about what stories offer to re-thinking
the institutionalization of late life has led to scholarly fulfilment and personal
joy. So, we start by thanking each other.
    Our scholarly partnership was made possible entirely by the support of our
mentors and colleagues, especially in the development of the European and
North American Networks on Aging Studies (ENAS & NANAS). The contri-
butions of its members are too many to enumerate, but we are grateful to the
scholarly and administrative work that has pushed the field to grow by leaps
and bounds. We have received impressive feedback to our panels about the
book topic at ENAS and NANAS conferences. We hope this book adds to the
richness of the field while provoking new critical questions that can only be
answered through fulsome debate and listening across differences.

Prologue
Betsy Struthers




The P ush
Such a beautiful day, Mom welcomes
me in. She’s fully dressed, hair
freshly permed. Can we go out
for a walk? In the elevator
and along the hall to the vestibule,
she chatters about the blue eggs
in the nest on the dining room window sill.
When they will hatch. When the chicks
will fly. The whole floor’s making bets.
Smell the lilacs, listen to those birds!
We head for the glasshouse in the park,
three blocks, one busy street, and there
we’re stopped – I can’t tip the wheelchair
over the stubborn curb, afraid I’ll lose my grip.
Let me, two tattooed arms crook down
to lift the chair and Mom, as if
they were weightless, and sets them right.
Thanks, I stutter. He waves my words away
and bows, Grandmother, I honour
your days, turns and shambles off
to join a group of men sprawled, playing
cards on a low stone wall. She’s quiet
when we enter the tropic dome, the rooms
of tulips, hyacinths, the crown of thorns.
I’m tired, take me back. Click of tires
over pavement cracks, the rhythm
like that of my son in his stroller,
the same strain to push against the pull
of the slope ahead. The signal flashes
red. I stoop to tuck her shawl. You’re good
to me, she says and clasps my hand
in both of hers. Like that, we’re stuck,
waiting for the changing of the light.
Introduction
Care Home Stories
Aging, Disability, and Long-Term Residential Care

Sally Chivers and Ulla Kriebernegg


This book is motivated by the need, in the face of population aging, to tell new
and better stories about institutional care. We take a close look at the stories
that circulate both in the popular press and across forms of more imaginative
popular culture in order to understand social, cultural, and political messages
that attach to what are commonly called “nursing homes.” We gather stories
from people who have worked and lived in long-term residential care that
capture the rich interplay of subjectivities and the complex relationships that
emerge in those spaces, both of which depend heavily on context.
    Whether in a nursing home, care home, retirement home, assisted living,
or other form, institutional care for seniors offers a cultural repository for fears
and hopes about an aging population. While people adamantly desire to age
well at home, without making the big move1 to render their latter years more
manageable, and policy makers play to that desire, apparently buoyed by how it
offers them an opportunity to download the costs of care onto the family unit,
the fact remains that many contemporary senior citizens will require institu-
tional care, and some might even choose it. Enormous changes have occurred
in how institutional care is structured, adapting models from the poor house
through the hospital to the home and the hotel and the village. But the legacies
of the poor house and the hospital persist, creating panicked views of the
nursing home as a dreaded fate for people who may actually benefit from new
living quarters in late life. The paradoxical nature of a space meant to be both
hospital and home offers up critical tensions for examination by age/ing studies
scholars. In this book, we gather imaginative critical and personal essays that
challenge stereotypes of institutional care for older adults, that illustrate the

     changes that have occurred over time, and that illuminate the continuities in
     the stories we tell about nursing homes.
         We want to change the script, in part, for Rhonda, the fictional character
     depicted on our book cover. The short Canadian film “Rhonda’s Party” portrays
     the collision of the unexpected with the predictable in the life of what we are
     calling in this book a “care home.”2 Rhonda doggedly prepares for her friend
     and fellow resident’s 100th birthday party while, unbeknownst to her, staff
     are signing papers that verify that her friend has died. The film lingers over
     choices about whether to continue with the party ritual to cover up the markedly
     bureaucratic form-signing rituals that punctuate death in the long-term care
     environment. Those contrasts are mirrored by visual contrasts in the cover
     image, between Rhonda’s serious face and the celebratory joy implied by the
     balloons, between the colourful round curve of the party balloons and the rigid
     dark lines of the corridor. Such potentially generative tensions permeate our
     book, which uncovers many ways in which the enforced rigidity of care home
     spaces is challenged by an undeniable infusion of humanity. Most importantly,
     Rhonda’s firm gaze at the camera reflects the centrality of the human experi-
     ence, in all its variety, in our thinking about care home stories. Our humanities
     perspective enriches a domain too often dominated by purported economic
     exigencies.
         The need to tell and analyze care home stories intensifies due to this era of
     New Public Management in which care homes currently operate. For example,
     immediately upon entering a “care centre” in the Canadian province of Ontario,
     visitors encounter a “Strategy Map.” This sign is the very first thing people see
     in what is advertised as a homelike atmosphere. Using corporatized language,
     this “map” explains how “Know How” leads to “Internal Processes” that benefit
     the “Customer” leading to “Financial” gains. These elements are pictured
     as all working together towards “strategic goals” of being bigger than other
     “retirement lodges” and the conglomerate that owns the care centre becoming
     the #1 choice in Long Term Care the following year. The map flows into a final
     coloured box which articulates a “Big Hairy Audacious Goal”: “to become the

     2 | The nomenclature of “care homes” is thorny enough to merit its own chapter. While
     “nursing home” is commonly used in North American popular contexts, it means
     different things in different jurisdictions. Not all the spaces we explore in this book
     include nursing, though all have to do with some form of paid or unpaid care work.
     While we don’t ignore the institutional legacy of these residences, we don’t want to
     unduly focus on that aspect of long-term residential care, itself an unwieldy phrase that
     conjures up unpleasant associations for some constituents (for example, indigenous
     people in Canada who were forced into residential schools). We have chosen to think
     about care home spaces and care home as a term, for all it evokes, in this book, though
     the other terms show up in relevant contexts.
                                                               Care Home Stories     19


Company that most changes the image of seniors’ services from a necessity to
a desire by 2020.”
     On a personal visit to that care home, when Sally chatted with another
visitor, that older woman openly gestured to and scoffed at the sign, asking,
“What does that have to do with me?” That question has stuck with us as we
have gathered personal and scholarly reflections about Care Home Stories. The
chart regretfully has everything to do with the older woman visitor because
it reflects the values of the institution where she has had to choose to place
her husband – this is a relatively fancy non-profit institution, not a last resort
among last resorts. The people who work there are forced to appear to think
in terms of the large boxes – “know-how,” “internal processes,” “customer,”
and “financial” – so that their employer can grow. Added to which, they work,
and he lives, in the most highly regulated yet worst funded sector in Ontario,
causing them to do more charting than body work.
     The “Strategy Map” tells that story and not myriad others that the visitor
might desire and immediately be able to place herself in. This book seeks to
contextualize that currently dominant story of long-term residential care: the
one that appears on the surface to have nothing to do with the people who live
there and the people who love them. We put that version among other stories
of everyday life in and around care homes. We want to know as much about
Rhonda’s party preparations, her anticipation of a friend’s remarkable cente-
narian celebration, and her imminent grief as we do about the hospital-like
corridored setting, the imposing nursing station, and the bureaucratic mecha-
nisms that manage death in the care home where she lives.
     We have gathered the stories and studies in this book because we believe
that we do indeed need to be audacious in setting goals for changing long
term residential care. But different contexts need different goals, and so we
should not narrow ourselves to one Big Hairy Audacious Goal. We need to
think about what values underlie the systems in which long-term residential
care operates, beyond those that situate seniors in need of care as “customers”
who contribute to or sap “financial” viability. Instead of aiming to grow our
business to become number one, and instead of supporting the notion that
public institutions ought to be run like businesses, we should all work together
to think about many different ways in which long-term residential care in late
life could become something desirable rather than necessary.



W hy C are ?
While thinking about care might seem to limit what we imagine later life to be,
the question especially of long-term care propels social and cultural meanings
of population aging. When the popular press is overwhelmed by negative
20   Sally Chivers and Ulla Kriebernegg


     images of older people, it is not just evoking fear about what each person’s fate
     might be – a deep fear of physical change that could bring pain and restriction
     to the activities of daily living, not to mention raising the spectre of death.
     Beyond that, images of older adults overtaking youth – often pictured as a giant
     wave – are about dependency. The idea that younger generations will have to
     do the work of care and, worse yet, pay for care is a significant portion of what
     makes such demographic projections play apocalyptically. Thus, we focus on
     care here because it is at the crux of age/ing studies. Changing the meaning of
     care stands to substantially change what it means to “age well.”



     W hy H ome ?
     Home appears throughout understandings of long-term residential care as an
     unquestioned ideal. The notion that institutional settings are improved when
     they are homelike goes virtually unquestioned. Not only is that assumption
     worth up-ending, so too must we question whose home these spaces are meant
     to be “like.” As Annmarie Adams and Sally Chivers point out in the context
     of design, “how to capture and conjure up an image of home to residents of
     various backgrounds” poses a “perennial challenge” (138). It is, perhaps, easier
     to pinpoint what is not homelike than to effectively describe let alone manifest
     homelikeness. We focus on home here because it is held up as an unquestioned
     good, particularly in policy documents that stress the widespread desire of
     people to age in place, meaning in their homes. But home is a thorny concept
     that benefits from interdisciplinary and international scrutiny.



     W hy S tories ?
     In The Truth about Stories, Thomas King famously states, “The truth about
     stories is, that’s all we are” (2). Yet care homes are not usually thought of as
     sites for new stories – instead the people who live within them are thought to be
     vessels for stories of a past from before they made the “big move.” We turn to
     stories to put the key terms of “care” and “home” together because they offer a
     meaningful and aesthetic way to contain and revel in multiplicities. A story can
     offer a few vantage points without taking a side but a story can also effectively
     and convincingly play favorites. There is no need for objectivity but rather a
     helpful indulgence in productive subjectivities. We think there are new stories
     to tell regarding care home spaces about, with and by the people who work, live
     and visit them.
                                                                Care Home Stories     21


The C ontributions
The 16 chapters collected in this volume, together with five poems, each in its
own way, challenge dominant understandings of institutional care, thinking
through how it has changed, and elucidating what has stayed constant in Care
Home Stories. They seek to answer questions such as, how do stories about
care homes challenge existing or create metaphors for institutional care? What
stories do people living or working in care tell? Who tells care home stories,
and who doesn’t get the chance to? How do people think they know what care
home life is like? How are care homes represented in poetry, film, art, fiction,
and popular media? And how do these stories change views about institutional
care?
    The book consists of four main sections with four chapters each: “Personal
Perspectives,” “Working and Playing in the Care Home,” “Literary and Cultural
Perspectives,” and “Social and Historical Perspectives.” Additionally, Betsy
Struthers’s poetry about her own mother’s dementia and death in a care home
helps structure this volume: each section is preceded by one of the five poems
she kindly agreed to share with us. “The Push” is our prologue because it beau-
tifully connects a very specific moment in time, a woman visiting her mother
in the care home and taking her for a walk in her wheelchair, to our constantly
changing roles and positions throughout the life course. More importantly, it
emphasizes the importance of intergenerational connections and care at every
moment throughout our lives.
    The book’s first section, “Personal Perspectives,” comprises subjective
experiences with institutional life. It is preceded by the poem “Pretty Little
Angels,” which offers a very personal account of a difficult visit in a care home.
By describing the unpleasant hospital-like atmosphere of the facility with its
elevators and nurses, its pastel colors, plastic vases, and disinfectant smell, the
speaker conveys the uneasy feeling entering such a surrogate home entails. The
ironic twist at the end of the poem almost offers some comic relief, but it still
hints at the difficulties and ambivalent feelings that accompanying one’s parent
through the last stages of their lives may bring about. In the opening chapter
that follows, almost weekly triangular care-home visits between 2008 and 2011
with her mother, her mother-in-law, and her good friend Robert Kroetsch are
at the center of Aritha van Herk’s creative non-fiction meditation “At Home
or Nowhere: In Memoriam – Pat Sharp in Edmonton; Marretje van Herk in
Edmonton; Robert Kroetsch in Leduc.” She offers “a personal exploration from
the perspective of a family member and friend who watches and engages the
‘care home’ from without,” as she describes it in one of her initial email conver-
sations with us (van Herk). She not only offers an account of her relationships
with these three aging and increasingly frail persons but also shares, in her
very own poetic voice, her reflections on how these “explorations into the heart
22   Sally Chivers and Ulla Kriebernegg


     of oldness” shaped her own ideas, fears, and imaginations of growing old. In
     the next chapter, “Home Interrupted,” Monique Lanoix examines how institu-
     tional care offered to younger individuals makes it difficult to feel at home in an
     institutional setting. She tells the story of her husband’s institutionalization in
     a Québecois care home upon a severe accident that left him severely injured and
     in need of long-term care. Lanoix draws out her experience of the institution’s
     liminality and transience, analyzing how in addition to the spatial setting, daily
     practices of care continually emphasize the “not-home” within the living envi-
     ronment, creating what she calls “two-home syndrome.” She argues that home-
     likeness cannot be produced and maintained by the physical environment
     alone, but should be inscribed in the practices of care. This interest in possibil-
     ities for improvement also characterizes Amanda Barusch’s chapter, “A Place
     for Dad: One Family’s Experience of For-Profit Care,” in which she reflects inci-
     sively on the challenges she had to face when her father, who lived many hours
     away from her with his second wife, was diagnosed with dementia and needed
     care that his wife could no longer provide herself. Barusch, an academic geron-
     tologist, documents the process of gradually moving her father into institu-
     tional care with sensitivity, including personal e-mail conversations with Cath-
     erine, which underline the challenging role Barusch found herself playing.
     Barusch contextualizes her personal story with a very informative overview of
     the development of long-term care in the United States. In the final chapter of
     the section, one of the rare first-hand accounts of what it is like to reside in a
     Continuing Care Retirement Community is provided by Anne Wyatt-Brown in
     her essay “Life in a Continuing Care Retirement Community: On Not Being
     Invisible.” After outlining why she eventually decided to move to Roland Park
     Place, she addresses the challenges this transition has brought about for her by
     juxtaposing her own experience as a gerontologist with self-help books, such
     as Stephen Golant’s, on where to live in old age. She reflects on her struggle
     to keep her autonomy and independence by reporting about how she and her
     fellow residents, who had become her friends, reacted to the change of staff in
     the Roland Park Place’s fitness center, a place of crucial importance to her as it
     had given her a sense of belonging. She argues for the need to combine geron-
     tological knowledge with personal observations in order to help others make
     good decisions on where to live in old age.
         Section two, “Working and Playing in the Care Home,” is prefaced by Betsy
     Struthers’s poem “Second Sitting,”3 which contemplates the lack of personal
     attachment and friendship in a care home and emphasizes the anonymity
     shared by its residents. The four contributions that follow center on personal
     experiences and on-site research that has been conducted in care homes, albeit

     3 | An earlier version of “Second Sitting” was previously published in Sugar Mule 33 and

from very different perspectives. In “Shelter in Place,” Laura Dunbar shares a
perceptive and poignant personal story about how she got be a nurse, how she
started work at a nursing home in Ontario, and how she struggled with recon-
ciling her daily duties in a highly regulated institution with her sense of what
adequate professional and personal caregiving meant for her. With her piece,
she lends a voice to the many nurses and nurses’ aides in care homes who are
usually underrepresented in research despite the fact that the quality of care
largely depends on them as they try on a daily basis despite adverse conditions
to help their clients maintain their dignity, and to treat them with kindness and
as human beings. The centrality of caring, personal relationships at all stages
throughout the life course is also at the centre of Peter Whitehouse’s article,
“Long-Term Care for the Future: Just What is Real Anyway?,” which offers two
stories about what he calls the realities and unrealities of care. His account
is based on the one hand on his experience of living as a part time resident/
researcher in The Terraces, an independent/assisted living facility that is part
of Baycrest Geriatric Centre, Toronto. On the other hand, it tells about White-
house’s visit to Hogewey, a long-term residence in The Netherlands for people
with dementia. Sharing the story of what has shaped his view on dementia care
and drawing conclusions from his on-site research, he argues for a change in
our understanding of long-term care that focuses on intergenerational learning
in order to create resilient communities that can face the social, economic, and
ecological challenges ahead of us. New perspectives on dementia care are also
offered by Julia Gray, Pia Kontos, Sherry Dupuis, Gail Mitchell, and Christine
Jonas-Simpson in their co-authored chapter “Dementia (Re)Performed: Inter-
rogating Tensions between Relational Engagement and Regulatory Policies in
Care Homes through Theatre,” which aims at disrupting the tragedy discourse
that informs cultural representation as well as policy making. Presenting two
scenes from their research-informed play Cracked: New Light on Dementia, they
show how theatre productions can intellectually and emotionally engage audi-
ences. Cracked was developed to open up a playful, social space to raise ques-
tions about current conceptions of dementia, expose unjust care practices and
policies, and facilitate envisioning and inspiring an alternative care culture.
Their analysis is framed by the personal/professional experiences and research
that informed the scenes’ development, as well as post-performance evalua-
tion data where dementia care practitioners discuss specific scenes as catalysts
for change. Similarly, Aynsley Moorhouse discusses how theatre can facilitate
new approaches to long-term care: In “‘Hooray for You and Me’: The Story of
a Theatre Group,” she illustrates how she developed and implemented a five-
month theatre and digital storytelling group for residents of a care home in
Toronto, Canada. She adapted an online blog for the chapter, guiding readers
through the development process and sharing her personal observations on
24   Sally Chivers and Ulla Kriebernegg


     how the production took shape. Her blog thus became a relationship-centred
     document that tells a care home story full of joy, laughter, creativity and growth.
         Betsy Struthers’s poem “My Mother Defines Purgatory,” opens section
     three, “Literary and Cultural Perspectives.” The poem offers a limited inside
     point-of-view of an old woman waking up slightly confused in her care home bed.
     She is helpless, disoriented, and desperate, also because the care she receives
     lacks compassion and does not fulfill her need for affection and kindness. On
     the contrary, she feels humiliated. The poem, like many fictional texts set in
     care homes, also criticizes the lack of privacy in institutional settings and,
     in a nutshell, describes what is commonly understood as “the nursing home
     specter.” While some works of fiction centre on the lack of agency, however,
     others portray old people as “active agers.” In her chapter, “The Third Age in
     the Third World: Outsourcing and Outrunning Old Age in The Best Exotic
     Marigold Hotel,” Amanda Ciafone turns to cinematic portrayals of old age as a
     time of affluence, self-determination, and activity. She explores old age through
     a critical reading of post-colonial theory and discusses India as the setting of
     these stories. Her text centres on the argument that the country is coded as
     exotically ‘other’ in order to portray the old characters as living the ends of
     their lives fully: they meet new lovers, build familial networks, and find new
     professions and passions. These life developments in old age are made to seem
     exceptional, then, and dependent on a fantasy backdrop to play out. A more
     realistic background is presented in Peter Simonsen’s chapter that investigates
     how, in Ian McEwan’s novel Saturday (2005), risks of terrorism and dementia
     are curiously parallel. It is typically read as a novel about the everyday fears and
     constant worries that entered many individual’s lives in the aftermath of the
     terrorist attacks of 9/11. This has shielded us, Peter argues, from an equally
     important aspect of the book: the way in which it captures the growing fears
     and constant worries entering many of our lives that we will end up as dementia
     patients. Patricia Life in her chapter “Outside the Nursing-Home Narrative:
     Race and Gender Exclusions in Green Grass, Running Water” then considers
     what types of texts are missing from what she calls the nursing-home-narrative
     genre and what types of people are absent from nursing homes. People such as
     the four old Indigenous patients who run away from the care home in Thomas
     King’s Green Grass, Running Water are excluded, feel excluded and/or exclude
     themselves from residency in Canadian institutions. Life’s study of King’s text
     reveals a need for age theorists and governments to address the thorny issue of
     intentional and unintentional segregation of care according to race and gender.
     Katrin Berndt and Jennifer Henke explore in their co-authored chapter “Love,
     Age, and Loyalty in Alice Munro’s ‘The Bear Came over the Mountain’ and
     Sarah Polley’s Away from Her” how the short story and its film adaptation deal
     with questions of commitment in a lifelong marriage challenged by the effects
     of dementia and the female protagonist’s move into a care home. They approach
                                                               Care Home Stories     25


both works from a narratological perspective and investigate how both fictional
representations of love, loyalty, age, and dementia invite a reading that empha-
sizes a new beginning even at a late point in life.
    “Rising Fog,” Betsy Struthers’s poem about saying good-bye to a mother left
behind in an unpleasant care home, initiates the fourth and last section of the
collection, “Social and Historical Perspectives.” This last poem finishes a kind
of narrative arc from ambulatory to bedridden, and starts by quoting Emily
Dickinson’s famous last words: “I must go in; the fog is rising.” The lyric I,
a daughter who is sitting on a bus on the highway, returning home from a
visit with her frail mother, finds herself haunted by the vision of her mother’s
clenched fists and stare when she has to leave her behind. She tries hard to
concentrate on what she sees outside: an owl, crows, geese, the lake, and rising
fog: over the lake, the moraine, and from her own breath on the bus’s window
pane. The fear of an old age defined by decline, dependency, and the loss of
agency that Betsy Struthers expresses through her poetic voice is addressed
from the perspective of sociology by Chris Gilleard and Paul Higgs. In their
chapter, “An Enveloping Shadow? The Role of the Nursing Home in the Social
Imaginary of the Fourth Age” they argue that the nursing home is both a site
and a symbol that fashions the social imaginary of a fourth age as it plays a
pivotal role in articulating the fourth age, the practices that play out under its
shadow, and the contradictions caught up in its denial. In the next chapter,
Marija Geiger Zeman, Zdenko Zeman, and Mirela Holy present a sociological
reading of a Croatian novel in their analysis “A New Home, A New Beginning,
A New Identity: Old Age, Life Narrative and Self-Presentation in the Novel The
Real Captain’s Sea by Zvonko Todorovski.” It focuses on literary presentations
of institutions of older persons, gender roles, and images, by which, finally,
the questions of identity, and dramaturgic, relational, emotional, and ontolog-
ical aspects of life narrative come into play. In the following chapter, spaces
and places of care are at the centre of Isabel Atzl and Anamaria Depner’s text
“Home Care Home: Reflections on the Differentiation of Space in Living and
Care Settings.” Using an inductive approach, they analyze from an interdis-
ciplinary perspective the role of objects in past and present nursing and care
settings. They discuss how nineteenth century nursing textbooks describe how
patient rooms should be designed and set up to be in line with the medical
guidelines of the time and compare them to state-of-the-art textbooks. Also,
they include excerpts from a field report to portray an example of daily life
in care facilities. Finally, James Struthers’s chapter “Home, Hotel, Hospital,
Hospice: Conflicting Images of Long-Term Residential Care in Ontario,
Canada” rounds off the collection. He explores a series of recurring stories
about care homes that featured prominently in policy discourse and in the
media primarily during the post–World War II era in Ontario and traces the
26   Sally Chivers and Ulla Kriebernegg


     development of caregiving institutions and their discursive framing from the
     poorhouse to modern-day facilities.
         Collectively these chapters and poems show there is much to be said about
     a place that too often is construed as a failure, a last resort, and a fate worse
     than death. In the course of working on the book together, we have had count-
     less discussions with other colleagues and friends about their own experiences
     making decisions for family members with regards to long-term care. We
     consider this book part of a longer and bigger conversation, and we hope you
     will join us.

Hope the elevator will be slow, or out of service,
but it pings open the second I touch the button.
At least it’s empty. At least, for the slow ascent
to the fourth floor, there’s time to compose
what to say. How to say it. Nod to the nurse
who nods back, smiles – or frowns, can’t tell,
don’t stop to ask. Don’t want to know. Pass tables
set with plastic cloths, acrylic vases, lurid
pink carnations. More pretense. Mom’s door
is closed, a new sign, her scrawl on white paper:
Knoc befor Enter. Letters large at the top, shrink,
drift to the lower corner. Tap. Wait. Tap again. Push
the door open, peek in: she’s still in the bed, sheet
tucked under chin, quilt bunched at the foot. That
smell: disinfectant, floor polish, piss. Hesitate
to enter, to wake her startled and afraid. Or
not wake her. Too long a pause until she croaks,
Is that you? Ease in, shrug off purse, jacket,
it’s hot in here. Open curtain, let in light, air.
The floor a spill of photos, crumpled notes.
She’s been moving things again. Losing things.
Crying on the phone about lost things. What
has been taken from her. What she misses
so much, has willfully abandoned. Clinging
to memory, she has turned her back
on the pigeons cooing on the sill, the children’s
singsong in the park across the street. Hears
only sirens – police, fire, the ambulance
she waits for, that will come for her. When
will it come? She clutches my wrist. Where
is your father? Is he really dead and buried?
And when I say Yes, years now, she begs,
Will he wait for me? All this time in heaven
with the pretty little angels, won’t one get
her hooks in him before I’m let to go there?
At Home or Nowhere
In Memoriam – Pat Sharp in Edmonton; Marretje van Herk
in Edmonton; Robert Kroetsch in Leduc

Aritha van Herk



During the years between 2008 and 2011, I made a triangular pilgrimage
frequently enough that it began to take on the shape of a ritual, at times a curse,
sometimes a mantra. The journey was in the nature of a requirement, but it
was also a pleasure, a practice, a series of epiphanic conjunctions, and it traced
that time of my life in a strangely triangular way.
    Every week or two – sometimes more often and sometimes less – I would
drive from my home in Calgary’s foothills up the Queen Elizabeth Highway
north. I have become an adamant Calgarian, and my journeys to Edmonton
were undertaken from a foreigner’s perspective and with an alien’s reluctance.
Although I had attended the University of Alberta in Edmonton and found
there both ardent love and foundational inspiration for my writing practice,
Edmonton itself is a city I am wary of, visitor rather than originary. Calgary is
where I feel at home, and Calgary is where I intend to live until I die, whether
that event is soon or distant.
    My visits to Edmonton were an exploration into the heart of oldness. I do
not mean that vague category of the aged combined with euphemisms about
“senior,” “golden,” or “latter” years, but another oldness, its frailty and frustra-
tion, its dread caducity, which can itself be traced to an older time, the eigh-
teenth-century French caducité, from the Latin caducus, or “liable to fall.”
    Falling identifies the cross-over zone between aging and old, the tipping
point between self-sufficiency and danger. Falls are the occasion when the old
grow intimate with mortality, for the medical profession attributes to falling
morbidity, or conversely, attributes morbidity to falling. The whole metaphor of
falling is itself laden with misery: the fall of man, a fall from grace, the fall or
autumn of life before the discontents of winter and the inevitable conclusion
of death. The connection between this chronic expectation and sin, transgres-
sion, lapse or wrongdoing is too obvious, but it speaks to the language and the
32   Aritha van Herk


     presumptions that attend our current attitudes toward the old and our fearful
     and apprehensive attitudes toward their presence. The discourse of preven-
     tion and fear attends our “care” for the aged, to the extent that they are them-
     selves infected by the very fear of falling that we fear for them. In the name
     of prevention, we reduce the scope of movement for older people and terrify
     them with the spectre of injury and bone fracture. The resultant “care” that
     we wield as threat and fret over elder parents and acquaintances becomes its
     own prognosis, and the fall assumes the magnitude of a curse or prediction as
     confining as the slowness of the aging body itself. The event of the fall argues
     for a liminal moment that declares competency, and it marks the transition
     between independence and the need for extended care. The accident – and how
     many of us have fallen accidentally, from our childhood onward – then decrees
     a new limitation for the old. We attribute to the fall infirmity, and in loading
     so much meaning on the slip, trip or over-balance, we inscribe and confine the
     elders we should encourage to keep moving. The “taxonomy” of falling and the
     need for prevention of injury resulting from falling then corral the old behind
     an invisible fence that adds to their isolation and fearfulness.
         My own trips up that relentless highway to Edmonton performed a similar
     and repeated fall, into the past, into the future, into a hiatus of elder care that
     seemed separate and isolated from the hustle of my current life, my work, my
     writing, and my personal passions. The best drives were those my husband and
     I took together, for we had then three intimate hours to talk, to tell jokes, to
     share our close experience of this changing genealogy and our history together.
         As the years passed, my mother and mother-in-law, both elderly, if never
     old, exerted different pressures and demands, on me, on other members of
     family, and on the life that they had left to live. They anticipated falling and
     yet refused to fall. My father, before he was placed in a care home, did fall,
     frequently (low blood pressure and diabetic symptoms), which terrified my
     mother, as she struggled, impossibly, to get him back on his feet. My sister, an
     implacably practical nurse, told my mother to leave him lying on the floor until
     he could get up – he was safer there than anywhere else because once he was on
     the floor he could not fall. But our human impulse is to push people upright, to
     get them on their feet, as if to reassure ourselves that the fall is both avoidable
     and erasable. After my father had fallen many times, he was placed in a care
     home, where he was monitored and provided with a walker, and where he did
     not again fall until he suffered the fatal stroke that finished his life.
         That care home was new, cheerful, and well appointed, with many social
     events and relatively good food, but my father hated it more passionately than
     the many other hatreds he had harboured in his life. He sat at his desk in
     his room and read, wrote notes about his life, and yearned to escape. He was
     happiest when we took him for a drive out into the country; he seemed to
     immerse himself into the landscape that he had loved and worked for so many
                                                               At Home or Nowhere      33


years of his life, the canola fields stretching yellow and lush, and the green
swaths of wheat and oats rippling in the Alberta wind. On movie nights, he
went down to the social room and got a box of popcorn, which he took back to
his room and ate while he watched the news. He was, to quote Robert Kroetsch
writing about his own father, “lonesome for death” (Completed Field Notes 7),
and death came to him ultimately as a kindness, an escape from his body and
his enclosure in that pleasant but imprisoning institution. His was the first
death, and although I did not yet know, a prefiguration of my triangular and
persistent years of driving to visit my mother-in-law, my mother, and my friend
Robert Kroetsch.
    My mother was the oldest of this trio but was the most overtly furious, and
she made a point of expressing her disappointment with the indignities of aging
as vociferously as she had lived. Although my father had died in the care home,
she was adamant that she would not, and she continued to live in her own apart-
ment – their own apartment – until just before her death. She went directly
from that place to a hospice, refusing medical intervention for her cancerous
tumour, and she died very shortly thereafter, at 93. Despite her seething impo-
tence in the face of increasing age and disability (she had macular degeneration
and was virtually blind), she was relatively lucky, although she would not have
claimed good fortune. She was enraged by age, enraged by time’s passage and
her blindness, a woman who devoured books throughout her life and in her last
years read the library books delivered to her door with a magnifying glass as
large as a cookie sheet. She put her thumb into her cup to gauge the level of the
liquid, she checked that the stove burners were off by feeling the positions of
the knobs, and she refused to carry a white cane or any marker of her disability.
“I am not blind,” she declared, as if the very words would deny her condition.
    Her indignation was the culmination of a long life of hard work and incred-
ible privation. Eloquent and acerbic, her humour balanced a toughness that she
had learned from multiple displacements. She was twelve when her mother
died, a loss she grieved her whole life; powerfully intelligent and curious, she
had to leave school to take care of her brothers and sisters; she learned the skills
of gardening and cheese-making in the Netherlands under the harshest of
conditions; she married my father in the first days after the defeat of the Dutch
by the Nazis; she gave birth to two children during an occupation that subju-
gated and starved the entire population; she welcomed Canadian troops as
liberators in 1945; she immigrated to a bewilderingly unfamiliar Canada with
three children and my father, without knowing a word of English except potato;
she travelled by train from Pier 21 and Halifax to Alberta without knowing
where or how far Alberta was; she lived in a granary and worked with my father
for $ 60 a month; she had three more Canadian children; she taught herself
to read and write English from my siblings’ elementary schoolbooks; and she
worked every day of her life to keep her family clean and fed. She poured into
34   Aritha van Herk


     our brains and our bloodstreams one word and one desire: education. “Study
     all you can, and you will always have something to fall back on.” Her fierce
     pride and rage are my inheritance; when I see or experience injustice, I feel
     the white-hot incandescence of her intense fury at the stupidity and oblivion
     of people who have lived a life spoiled and indifferent, especially if they are
     cowards or unconcerned with the pain they cause others.
         Visiting my mother meant I had to meet and respect her long-simmering
     anger, listen to her stories, and talk to her across the chasm separating our
     experiences, our different lives, my life as a writer and professor a virtual
     daydream to her.
         And I would ask again, “Mom, wouldn’t you be safer and more comfortable
     in a home?”
         “No.” Said with a fierceness that was as decisive and absolute as a boulder
     of granite.
         “But you’d have company.”
         “I don’t want company. Why would I want to talk to a bunch of old people?”
         “You’d get your meals, and they’d make sure you took your medication.”
         “I can cook. I know how to take my medication.”
         The circular logic of my mother was more than stubborn; it was irrefutable.
     She was difficult and demanding and definite, and she loved to argue with me,
     about every possible subject and position. Argument made her feel alive, and
     language was a country where she left behind the various infirmities of her
     body and her age and became all eloquence, as potently expressive as she had
     been throughout her life, despite her shift from her mother tongue to English,
     despite her limited formal education. Her refusal of a care home was certainly
     traceable back to her profound sense of independence, nurtured by a lifetime of
     certainty that she had to be self-reliant, that nothing and no one would rescue
     her or come to her defense. Her uniqueness was bolstered by her self-reliance,
     and that same self-reliance would have been compromised by a care home, even
     if she might have dared to enjoy the luxury of being waited on. And in retro-
     spective gratitude, I secretly know she would have turned the place upside-
     down, bedevilling staff and residents alike. My mother had that capacity for
     chaos, side by side with a sturdy pragmatism. It was the same prescient realism
     that made her say, as I was leaving the hospice one evening, “Goodbye, Aritha.”
     She was telling me that she would not see me again, that she was going to die.
     I refused to believe her, but she was right. It was goodbye.
         The difference between my mother and my mother-in-law decries compar-
     ison; the journeys of the aged are as divergent as their lives. My husband’s
     mother rambled from the large home where she had lived for some forty years
     with my father-in-law to, after his death, ten relatively independent years in a
     tidy up-and-down condo. The stairs finally persuaded her to relocate to a retire-
     ment home, called “assisted living,” with her own apartment, where meals
                                                               At Home or Nowhere      35


were provided and some nursing care was available. But for all its glossy patina,
that “assisted” living place was mostly interested in assisting well-off elderly
clients with disposal of their funds. The food was faux-gourmet, pre-prepared
by a broad-line food facilities service, and consistently mediocre. The place
suffered from poor ventilation and infestations of bedbugs – facts that were
artfully concealed. The nursing care was casual and more or less limited to a
stethoscope and a thermometer, along with speed dial to emergency services,
ambulances readily carting the elderly to hospital for actual treatment, where
they were treated with grudging attention, the murmured incantation of
“bed-blockers.”
    A bird-boned figure erect as her Scottish heritage, my mother-in-law grew
increasingly frail, and it was only a short time before that inevitable fall and
serious injury, a broken hip incapacitating her to the extent that the “assisted
living” facility would not assist, and she had to be moved to a nursing home,
euphemistically called a “compassionate care centre.” It claimed a beautiful,
wheelchair-accessible patio area overlooking a natural ravine, but I never saw
a single resident using that space. The nursing home had repurposed an old
building, tottering on its legs worse than its residents, and it could not expunge
the smell of death and defeat, the urine-soaked history of its defeated dénoue-
ments. Walking through its automatic doors never failed to make me want
to turn and run away, jump into my car, and drive straight into a concrete
abutment.
    Visiting her was increasingly challenging as her world narrowed, from
a room to a high-backed recliner chair to a fully mechanized hospital bed,
connection made more difficult as her physical health declined. She was, like
my own mother, cognizant and aware, with not a trace of dementia, but her
body slowly renounced itself, curling into frailty as if she were a desiccated bird
bone-cage. That gradual diminishment was a process as humiliating to her as
it was dispiriting to us, visiting her as often as we could, bringing fresh flowers,
photographs, reading the paper with her to keep her abreast of the world,
bringing her tempting food beyond the potage she was offered, and trying to
release her, as well as we were able, from the prison of her confinement. She
too did her valiant utmost, but her physical ability did not match her desire, and
eventually the very “care facility” that claimed to offer hope had nothing to give
but a disconsolate solicitude.
    The care home was a well-meaning but dreadful establishment; there is
no other way to summarize its creaking fabric and locked stairwells, its smell
of old potatoes and plastic drugs. Nothing is worse than a social hour hosting
queasy renditions of “The Old Rugged Cross” sung to a half-tuned piano, or
crumbs of aged slab cake meant to celebrate birthdays. The staff, mostly immi-
grants reduced to working at jobs they were overqualified for, were kind and
generous, and their humanity did much to counterbalance the ghastly atmo-
36   Aritha van Herk


     sphere of the institution, but even their best intentions could not disguise the
     sheer immanence of life’s closing doors or the attendant hopelessness of those
     who will never again feel direct sunlight on their faces.
          I did not want my mother-in-law in that facility, and my husband and I did
     all in our power to persuade her to move to a private place in Calgary, close to
     us. She did not want to be in that nursing home either, but she resisted with
     every bone of her weakening body the idea of leaving Edmonton, the city where
     she had lived for more than 70 years. Her own stubborn cognizance refused
     to countenance moving, and her increasing frailty worked in tandem with a
     shortage of long-term care beds and a vilely incompetent health-care system.
     By the time we got her moved up the long list of “available beds” into a “nicer”
     nursing home, she was entirely too frail to be moved. I came to believe that
     decrepitude conspires with demand.
          So I would leave each visit as dispirited as if I had been imprisoned with
     failure in a debtors’ prison as maggoty as a Dickens novel. My own mother
     was full of fight, mouthy and resistant, but my mother-in-law’s passive refusal
     was impossible to turn toward hope, and all I could do was turn the nose of
     my trusty little Jeep south down the Calgary Trail toward home, aware that
     the journey would repeat and repeat until she faded into her own extinguished
     breath.
          But between 2008 and 2011, I always made one last stop on my drive south.
     I would pull into the parking lot of a retirement “home” located on the west
     edge of Leduc. With an increasing sense of relief, I would press the security
     intercom for #325, to be met with a whirl of industrious pleasure, Robert
     Kroetsch declaring, as only he could, “Let’s go for ice-cream!” or “Let’s go for
     a drive,” brandishing a blue aluminum cane that seemed more for decoration
     than safety or assistance.
          When I first heard that Robert Kroetsch (possibly the largest projection of
     writerly vitality in Canada) had relocated himself from Winnipeg to a retire-
     ment home in Leduc, I was quite simply shocked. I could not conceive of him
     in a closing chapter of life or of him voluntarily acceding to agedness or to any
     version of care. When I called and asked him what he was thinking, and how he
     had arrived at this migration back to Alberta, he answered with inscrutable and
     certainly poetic deliberation, “I am practising up how to get old.”
          He took to the life of a retirement home with the style of a man who enjoyed
     domestic ritual and regular meals and yet cherished his privacy and his differ-
     ence from others. It was a new facility and seemed more secure apartment
     complex than care home, although nurses and doctors were on call. Most of
     the residents had no idea that he was a famous Canadian writer. He shared
     his meals with them in a communal dining room, played cards, and even
     went on excursions. One of his sisters, who lived not far away, helped with
     errands and laundry. He invited no one from the home, he said, having invited
                                                                At Home or Nowhere      37


me, into his small private apartment, where he had a comfortable armchair, a
small bookcase, and a window overlooking a gas station across the road. In the
bedroom was a desk with an ancient computer, and in the narrow kitchen, a
table where he ate toast in the mornings.
     It was difficult to discern whether he was happy. His own careful choosing
of a place where he felt, it seemed, reasonably safe and that met his simple stan-
dards of care, was a measure of his awareness. He was a man of a generation
not well acquainted with self-sustenance, and a kitchen was alien territory to
him. While he was not disabled, he had, he told me, begun to fall, and he knew
that he would need increasing medical attention. The bradykinesia and tremors
associated with Parkinson’s were growing worse, and his own relentless atten-
tion to poetic detail certainly attuned him to the increasing frailty of his body.
He had returned to the Parkland of Alberta, the place that inspired his brilliant
poetry and fiction; he had company if he wanted, family close to him, and he
appeared to face the spectre of “old” head on. I attribute to him a clear-eyed
realism in facing old age, but that could be my own invention, one I rely on to
comfort myself. He continued to write, he had myriad visitors, and he loved
excursions and trips.
     One summer day, sitting on a bench outside his favourite ice-cream source
in Leduc, he said, “I’ve found the title for my new book of poetry. Guess what
it is!” And when I waited, expectantly, he announced, with a gleeful relish that
encompassed all the pleasures and regrets of a life brimful of event, if not quiet
happiness, “Too Bad!” We both burst out laughing, aware of that ironic phrase,
its emphatic rejoinder, its sheer audacity, as if he were saying to age itself, “Just
don’t go overboard with the gratitude or the constative evaluation.” Life perhaps
regrettable but now beyond retrieval.
     And when he died suddenly, just before his 84th birthday, in an automobile
accident, he seemed, for all his cane and his Parkinsonian tremor, younger
than any of us, more prepared, more adaptable, and more aware of the conjoin-
ment of care with independence. My visits with him in those last years revealed
no resentment that he was growing infirm, that he needed to live in a care
home, that he was alone, and probably lonely. We played with language, told
one another stories, and talked about literature; his enthusiasm for his own
long relationship to writing never faltered, and so, although I suspected he was
deeply sad, he performed an ongoing role with practiced gusto.
     His last reading, at the Canmore artsPeak Literary Saloon on Sunday 19
June 2011, was met with a standing ovation for a poem on risk, and he said to
the organizers later that evening, as they report without a trace of irony, “If I die
now, I’ll die happy.” Just two days later, he was killed.
     My triangle was broken. All three of the old persons I pilgrimaged toward
and away from are dead. I grieve them equally, if in different ways. Their
staunch engagement with life despite the challenges of aging, and their own

     about how we “practise up” to get old. Their associations with care, whether to
     accept help or to resist, their passivity or their activity, declared far more than

     life and the next.

                                        “Do not worry; we will take good care of him.
                                        We take good care of our residents.”



These words are meant to reassure me and help me to move on, whatever that
implies, as my husband enters long-term care. However, years later, I still hear
them and they continue to instill fright and send a chill down my spine, just
as they did when I first heard them. At this initial meeting, I wonder: “Who
are you to take good care of him? And why do you say ‘our’ residents? Those
are individuals; they are not yours, no one gave them to you.” And so this is
the first part of entering long-term care: a process that is meant to alleviate my
burden by effectively removing my husband from my care. Granted, I could not
take care of him at “home,” so here we are in the hallway of a nursing home.
He is unaware of what is going on, and I am in a kind of shock. I say “a kind of
shock” because the journey from the car accident to this facility has taken us to
a variety of medical settings. Nevertheless, this new setting now presents itself
as a place of permanence. The comfort I may have found in the transitory nature
of the other medical settings is removed by the reality of this new “home.”
    This is a public long-term care institution: funded by the Quebec provin-
cial government and subject to provincial standards. Nevertheless, the
physical space is old; it looks like a hospital; the shared room in which he will
be spending much of his days is too small to accommodate him and another
resident together. My husband will need to be moved from the original place-
ment, and the other residents will simply be shuffled to other rooms so that he
can be transferred to a larger room.
    It seems that, in this place, “a room of one’s own” is granted only on a
temporary basis. In any case the rooms are rather interchangeable, and they
do not have much wall space to accommodate personalization. It is hard to
claim ownership of such spaces, and it appears as if very few residents have
tried to do so. Really, only one’s bed is “one’s own,” and I suspect this is
more for sanitary reasons than actually granting ownership to any one resi-
40   Monique Lanoix


     dent.1 This place appears temporary in a permanent way; I’ve heard it called
     “God’s waiting room.” I can only presume that the thinking goes like this:
     why encourage ownership, when the resident is expected to depart? That is the
     one certainty – death – although the timing might be unpredictable. As in the
     departure lounge of an airport, when you leave, you leave nothing behind. It
     just makes everyone’s life easier that way. The atmosphere is one of instability
     amid un-change: there is the recognized fragility of being, yet nothing is done
     to support it or even grant it dignity. Here, this fragility is a fact of life that must
     be accommodated. It is a source of employment, although those for whom one
     cares continually shift: different bodies, same care.



     D isrup tion
     It may appear incongruous, yet within the formidable institutional structure
     that is long-term care, transience remains a permanent feature. Some of the
     literature on long-term care institutions uses the concept of liminality to
     capture the atmosphere that reigns in such locations. As Leibing et al. explain
     in their article on living spaces and older individuals, liminality can be used to
     denote a transitory state, of being betwixt and between, or it can also denote
     a static state in itself (12).2 For these authors as well as others who have used
     the concept of liminality to examine facets of long-term care, the central idea
     is one of uncertainty, of not having a specific location.3 Liminality indicates a
     grey zone of ambiguity, of not being anywhere in particular for any set length
     of time. If the institutions tend to be architecturally similar and the care rather
     uniform, there is always a feeling of uncertainty. In part, this is because the
     people inhabiting nursing homes are usually in the last phase of their lives. So
     when a resident dies, there is often no official acknowledgement of his or her
     passing. All of a sudden, the person is no longer there and soon someone else
     occupies the room.4 It makes for a fragile and shifting community, where loss

     have a memory book at the entrance of the building where the life of a resident can be
     celebrated and the loss acknowledged.

lurks but remains unacknowledged. Perhaps this silence is meant to diffuse the
fear that death is always near. For the staff, it may help them normalize death
as an inevitable component of their routine of care.
    The status of most people in residential care is that of outsiders, even if
they remain within society. They are not completely outside the flow of society,
but they are certainly marginal to it. The time of residence in long-term care is
expected to be rather short for most residents.5 This may reinforce the sense of
liminality, and it may be an excuse for the lack of effort to redress this feeling.
Nevertheless, for those who are older it becomes an inevitable phase of life,
even if unpleasant, especially since we are living much longer. However, my
husband’s situation defies even this marginal acceptance. He was in good
health, he had a job, and he could be readily perceived as contributing to society.
Now, at barely 40 years of age, he has suddenly become a broken, unrepair-
able human being who is institutionalized. As one care provider told me, he
is expensive to the system: he has been in a nursing home for a long time,
requiring the maximum number of care hours.6
    At this point, I need to explain how my husband and I came to such a
juncture, so I will now start the story from the grim beginning. Some years
ago, my husband and I were in a car accident. He suffered a severe traumatic
brain injury that has left him quite disabled, both physically and cognitively;
he requires care for all his needs. After more than four months in acute care,
he was transferred to a rehabilitation centre, where he stayed for more than six
months. The practice has since changed. I doubt that a person with his level
of injury would be offered any rehabilitation today and, if they were, it would
be for a much shorter time period. Toward the end of my husband’s stay, the
rehabilitation team concluded that he would not make any appreciable gains
and would never regain anything close to a functional status. So he was even-
tually discharged with the goal of sending him to a long-term care institution.
Since placement was not immediately available, he was moved to a long-term
care wing of an acute-care hospital – again another disruption, although one
that is fairly routine.
    It is often the case that a patient goes from an acute-care setting to rehabili-
tation and is then sent to his or her prior home. That had been the process that
I had followed after my own injuries. The rehabilitation centre was not meant
to be a homelike environment; it was a deliberate attempt to simulate home in
order to prepare patients for their return to their original abodes. For example,
during my rehabilitation, I experienced simulated stairs, bikes, and kitchens in

     order to regain functionality. These substitutes were obvious and were usually
     embraced, as they held the promise of returning home: necessary steps to
     regaining some form of normality. However, in the case of my husband, there
     was no such hope. So we had to envisage leaving rehabilitation to go to a new a
     place of faux permanence – an institution. This meant having to adjust my goal
     and hope of sharing a home with him.
         Throughout the course of my husband’s rehabilitation, the practitioners at
     the centre watched me in order to gauge how I would cope with the realiza-
     tion that home would have to change meaning for me. They encouraged me
     to think of my husband as finding a place where his needs would be met, and
     that I could then be relieved of any worry or burden of having to care for him.
     They did not frame the long-term care place as an eventual homelike envi-
     ronment, but rather as a place where he could be cared for. The disruption at
     this time was the expectation that my life and that of my husband could be
     neatly separated. I could continue to live as I had previously lived and function
     normally, and he would simply become the institutional charge of the medical
     system. There was little room for negotiation or for any other way of including
     my husband into the story of my life without this very permanent rupture. I
     felt an imposed sundering of our lives. To think otherwise was perceived as
     abnormal: why would one continue to have an extended relationship with an
     institutionalized other? Yes, there could be regular visits at holiday and signif-
     icant times, but our lives would have to take separate trajectories and intersect
     only briefly at those times.
         From the hopeful world of rehabilitation then came the discharge to
     whatever acute-care hospital had the means to care for a patient with total needs
     awaiting long-term care placement. This transfer was upsetting, but the experi-
     ence of rehabilitation had been so terrible that it was almost a relief to be out of
     a setting where one was constantly reminded of being a failure. The head nurse
     of the long-term wing was not thrilled to have “heavy patients,” as it meant more
     staff were needed, and I am sure she had to deal with budget considerations.
     She was eager to have him placed as soon as possible, and she did not react
     well when I refused the first place that came open. My refusal was based on the
     location and accessibility of the long-term care establishment. It was important
     to me that I could easily reach my husband’s new permanent living space, and
     access to public transportation played a key role in my decision. It took over six
     months for him to get placement in a nursing home that could meet our needs.
     When the time came to move to the long-term care institution, the break from
     the acute-care wing was less problematic, as I had been told many times that it
     would be temporary, but I did have to say goodbye to care workers who had been
     kind to us. Always on the journey through these different settings, we found
     leaving some of the practitioners to be difficult.

     At the time of my husband’s admission to the long-term care centre, I was
not particularly disturbed by the medicalized environment; in fact, I was used
to it. I think that if the nursing home had been a more homelike and friendly
environment, I might have been more unsettled because it would really have
appeared as if my husband was going to have another home and I would poten-
tially be excluded. As it was, the medicalized setting was simply a continuation
of what I was used to.



A D isturbing P resence
In Quebec, as in many jurisdictions across Canada, nursing homes or, more
accurately, long-term care institutions provide care according to the hours of
assistance required by individuals. Residents are housed according to the hours
of care required and not according to age, which means that some institutions
can have heterogeneous populations.7 Given that individuals regardless of age
may require extensive care, there have been recommendations to have separate
places where younger individuals can live (Association québécoise d’établisse-
ments de santé et de services sociaux). Unfortunately, my husband is so severely
disabled, and at that time he was not taken to be aware of his surroundings,
that such an option was not even considered. In order to give a more complete
picture of the situation, I will at this point clarify his cognitive abilities, as those
are hard to gauge in the case of a head injury. He recognizes me and can answer
simple requests with a yes or no. He can be verbal, but he needs to be calm and
can get very agitated quite easily. This is typical of an individual with a head
injury, especially one in which the frontal lobes are damaged. Such individuals
have difficulty dealing with any new stimulus.
    When he first entered the long-term care institution, he was a bit of anomaly
as an individual with a severe traumatic head injury. Most residents were older
or, if they were younger, had degenerative neurological conditions such as
multiple sclerosis and did not have major behavioural issues such as yelling or
swearing. Coping with someone with a head injury requires specialized care,
which was not available since the institution was focused primarily on dealing
with physical needs.
    At first, the personnel were very nice and certainly had empathy for a younger
person who had suffered such a tragic fate. Their lack of training did not help
them understand the negative sides of a head injury, however, and at times my
relationship with them was quite strained. I was spending a fair amount of
time there initially. Since they saw their job as taking care of someone who

44   Monique Lanoix


     could no longer function, my presence was superfluous and they could not
     understand what I was doing there. As far as they were concerned, I should
     simply go on with my life and leave my husband behind; I was hanging on. If
     my presence was tolerated and even encouraged in the rehabilitation setting
     as part of my husband’s recovery process, in the nursing home I became an
     intruder, a disruption to the flow of care.8 However, I was not ready to go on
     with life without somehow keeping my husband in it. In addition, I was not
     convinced that the care he was getting was adequate. My problem was to nego-
     tiate the seemingly irreconcilable goals of keeping an eye on my husband’s care
     and living my life as a functional individual in the normal flow of society.
         If finding and claiming my place within the nursing-home context was diffi-
     cult, it was also a challenge in my regular life. While I was writing my doctoral
     dissertation, my schedule was fairly flexible and I did not have to account for
     my time. However, when I started teaching, when asked about my personal
     life I would explain that my husband was in a nursing home. This declara-
     tion was usually met with awkward silence. I took the decision to simply stop
     mentioning him or my visits, as it was an unsettling reminder that life does not
     always progress smoothly in expected ways.



     Two -H ome S yndrome
     When a close family member is institutionalized, those who are left behind
     are faced with an incomplete or somewhat broken home. I have tried to recap-
     ture the spirit of home in the location where my husband is living. I have thus
     become someone with two homes: one that was the home I furnished and
     inhabited with my husband and where he no longer lives, the second a place
     where I can sit in an uncomfortable chair and share small pleasures with him
     such as watching television. In addition to the awkward room arrangement,
     which often means that one is sharing a room with a stranger and his or her
     family, the physical surroundings are uncomfortable in this new living space. I
     have only a small chair to sit in, and since my husband spends most of his time
     in bed, the room has become the primary framework of life.

     8 | While often unrecognized, families play an important role in the care of institution-
     alized family members. In their study, Keefe and Fancey recommend integrating family
     members in the care structure. In his review of American long-term care institutions,
     Gaugler explains that programs have been put forward to improve family involvement
     as well as relationships between staff and family. However, in my experience, such
     programs have not been put in place in Quebec. The only change I have witnessed is
     the fact that family members are invited to participate in team meetings concerning the
     care of family members. These meetings take place once a year.
                                                                Home Interrupted     45


    I call this the two-home syndrome: one is never quite at home when one
is at the old home, and the other place is not really a home. The negotiation of
the disruption of home into two places may take a while to accomplish. One
can try to make the second homelike environment somewhat pleasant, but it
always has to be negotiated through institutional structures and lack of privacy.
So for some time one may be in a liminal space: never at home in any of the
two homes. It can certainly be negotiated eventually, but it takes both time and
conscious effort. I would say that the rupture is never mended but the situation
can become normalized. One learns to live with one home and another good
enough home where the family member lives. It becomes an interruption that
can be navigated.
    My solution at the time of my husband’s arrival at the long-term care home
was simple: since I could not do much about the surroundings, I tried to make
his room homelike by being there and sharing time with him. I understand
now that my presence was disturbing to the staff. They were used to going
about their routine unfettered by intruders, and my constant presence somehow
interrupted the flow of care and their patterns of work. Nevertheless, I believe
that my husband was aware enough of his surroundings to know he was in an
odd place, and that my presence was at least a familiar and stabilizing element
in the confusion of his new institutional life.
    As I understood it then, and still understand it now, home is about being
close to loved ones; it is about sharing space where one feels relaxed with close
others. If I could be close to my husband and he felt close to me, I believed that
I could still capture an essential element of home, even if the surroundings
belied home and screamed “institution.” If my home came to an abrupt end
with the car accident, my seeking and trying to build “home” continued despite
the institutional flow of life that was taken to somehow encourage homelike-
ness, without ever actually achieving it.



The E bb and F low of C are
Over the years that my husband has been living in this institution, changes
have taken place. This particular long-term care centre sits at the crossroads
of institutional transformation. That is, the centre has a long history of being
an institution for the “sick and destitute incurables,” as an account of the
centre explains (Grace Dart Extended Care Centre). At the beginning of the
last century it was a hospital for tuberculosis, and then in the mid-twentieth
century it became a centre that accepted individuals who could not function
without care in mainstream society. Since at that time persons with disabilities
were institutionalized far more routinely, some of the residents who had been
there for a long time would not be institutionalized today. It made for a varied
46   Monique Lanoix


     community of residents. However, at the end of the twentieth century, social
     conditions for institutions started changing. The Quebec ministry responsible
     for long-term care saw nursing homes no longer as institutions but rather as a
     milieu de vie substitut, or a homelike environment (Ministère de la Santé et des
     Services sociaux). Therefore, the institution where my husband lives has had to
     change or at least try to adapt to this new philosophy.9
          As this shift swept through in the late 1990s, long-term care institutions
     were under pressure to become more homelike. Recognizing that as a society
     we were living longer and that many older persons could not remain in their
     homes, the focus of the ministry was to de-institutionalize long-term care
     centres or at least make them feel more homelike. In part, the impetus for
     this alternative homelike environment, or milieu de vie substitut, is to encourage
     residents to adapt to a new life. These individuals should still feel as if they were
     in a home and not in a hospital, which is what most long-term care institutions
     evolved from. And the emphasis on “homelike” is meant to encourage this new
     life to be as normalized as possible. It is also an explicit recognition that the
     person still has a life to lead; she or he is not simply in “God’s waiting room”.
     This is a good way to think about the new phase of life: an active part of living.
     Instead of waiting for death, the focus on “homelike” puts life as the main
     concern. And since the majority of residents are long retired or, in any case,
     elderly, and were probably doing much of their living in their homes, home was
     the primary place where they spent their time. Home is a significant emotional
     tie to life, at least in term of physical surroundings. So it made sense that long-
     term care institutions should strive to create a homelike feeling within their
     physical surroundings.
          This is what happened at my husband’s institution. If the centre could
     not change its overarching physical structure – the corridors are long and the
     rooms are hospital-like – it could at least become more attractive. The rooms
     were painted and some of the offices were changed into larger living rooms with
     television sets and communal tables. The effort was commendable and seemed
     to make some residents and family members happy. At the time of the initial
     renovations, I was a member of the residents’ committee, and the president
     of the committee, who had lived there for quite a long time, was most thrilled
     with these improvements. The effort was designed to change the immediate
     surroundings of the institution: what could be seen by the residents in their

     9 | As stated on the web site, “The mission of the long term care centre is to offer, in
     a temporary or permanent fashion, a substitute home environment, housing services,
     assistance, support and surveillance services, as well as rehabilitation, psychoso-
     cial, nursing, pharmaceutical and medical services to adults who, due to their loss of
     functional or psychosocial autonomy, can’t reside in their natural home environment,
     despite the support of their entourage” (Grace Dart Extended Care Centre).

daily routines. I must say that it certainly was more pleasant to walk around and
to be able to watch television or simply sit around a table.
    Such changes signal a move away from characterization of long-term care
institutions as primarily liminal spaces. The changed interior is meant to
anchor life in the everydayness of a facsimile of home; thus, it encourages the
view of long-term care as a phase of life. I think the effort is quite notable and has
been in place in most jurisdictions in Quebec and across Canada, depending
on budgets, of course. There is nonetheless still an element of liminality in
the sense that long-term care, in most cases, is the final destination before
one dies. This can never be erased, since the population that inhabits these
centres is taken to be at the final phase of life. However, the emphasis on the
pleasant surroundings tries to erase at least some of the negative connotations
of moving into a long-term care centre. In addition, the renovations and small
improvements are part of an attempt to move away from long-term care institu-
tions as “total institutions” (Goffman).
    Transforming the immediate physical surroundings is an important first
step, but it has remained the only step. If the surroundings play an important
part in creating an atmosphere of home, there are other facets to institutional
care that should change also. Institutions are not simply a physical structure;
they are also a place where people work and, particularly in the case of long-
term care centres, live.
    The centre where my husband lives is regulated by the clock. It is certainly
the case that our lives in general are regulated by going to work or school at
set times and eating according to a schedule, but this regimentation is even
more pronounced in institutions. And the interruptions are usually out of the
resident’s or family’s control. For example, the assistance that takes place regu-
larly at set hours in order to maintain efficiency produces small but contin-
uous disruptions to the flow of life. Sometimes, the staff can help someone if
they ring. However, care is scheduled in rounds. This is a direct consequence
of the medicalized environment from which long-term care originates and in
which the nurse goes around giving patients their medicine according to a set
schedule. Similarly, in institutions, at set times, care workers go from room to
room to reposition the resident or check if the resident needs to be changed.
Despite the discourse surrounding the importance of home, a medicalized
structure still prevails in long-term care facilities.
    In addition, efficiency regulates institutional care, and it is perceived as most
efficient if certain caregiving activities take place at set times. As one resident
told me, “In effect what happens is the staff all gets going at the same time and
then they all sit down at the same time.” Individuals who have mobility impair-
ments need to be repositioned every two to four hours to prevent pressure
wounds. Therefore, when residents need to be repositioned, institutional effi-
ciency demands that it be done room by room, starting at a set time each day
48   Monique Lanoix


     and ending at roughly a set time. This in part fulfills the goals of long-term
     care, which include providing personalized care in a safe and secure environ-
     ment, yet it is at odds with the goal of providing care in a familial atmosphere.10
     Perhaps it is too much to ask for, given the medicalized environment in which
     care takes place. Still, the notion of the “not-home” is thus continually being
     suggested by the small and continuous interruptions that arrive at set times.
     Instead of punctuating special times of day, such as lunch or dinner, they often
     disrupt the daily flow of life.
         When they have to provide care, some of the care workers or orderlies will
     be polite upon entering the room. They may announce that they are coming
     in to check on the resident, but very often, as is the case with my husband,
     they will just come and accomplish whatever needs to be done. They are on
     tight schedules, so they do not have much time to chat.11 When someone has
     impaired cognition, such as my husband, it may simply be assumed that the
     person does not really understand what is going on, and actually telling him
     what is going to take place will be perceived as a waste of time. As one care
     worker said to another worker when speaking about my husband, “Why bother
     asking him? He is just going to swear.” This in fact demonstrates that the care
     worker does not really know how to handle a person with a head injury and has
     not taken the time to understand what is going on. So-called personalized care
     is actually rather impersonal, and this is in part for the sake of efficiency. It is
     not personalized care per se but individualized care in that every individual gets
     cared for personally. In that sense, it is individualized care: every individual
     receives care that is adequate for him or her. However, it remains impersonal
     as the needs of each resident are not contextualized but rather remain general-
     ized, to be taken care of at regular and predictable times.
         This broken flow of life affects the quality of homelikeness in a couple
     of ways. These small interruptions serve as reminders to residents and their
     families that they are living in a facsimile of home where the likeness is in
     fact quite superficial. If a resident is watching television, he or she can be
     interrupted by the rounds. That is a fact of institutional life that cannot be
     controlled, and it is often what most people fear about institutions: they become
     objects of care. The individuality of the resident gets lost in the timetabling of
     care. As I sit there with my husband quietly, I am always aware that at 2:30 or
     so, someone will come to reposition him. If the flow of life is often disrupted
     in regular life, it becomes ingrained in institutions. There may be some efforts
     to accommodate individual needs, but if such needs are not medical, are just

     explains: “Favoriser l’aménagement de milieux de vie sécuritaires, personnalisés et
     empreints d’une atmosphère familiale.”

a matter of preference, and cannot fit neatly into the regularized flow of care,
they remain unmet.
    In addition, the structure of care is such that a person’s most intimate care
is provided by persons who will usually remain strangers. In some ways that
can be liberating, but in other ways it reinscribes the notion of not-home. Some
individuals may prefer to get care from persons who are not family; in that
way they preserve the intimacy of the bond with the family member. Even in
such cases, the caregiver will be someone who will become familiar. However,
this does not really happen in institutions. Workers must remain professionally
detached, and it is often the rule of establishments that a certain distance must
be maintained.12 It is a difficult negotiation to make, and care workers are not
supported enough in this. Workers respect the privacy of the medical dossier,
but at the same time, the structure of care provision has an impact upon the
privacy of residents. One is very seldom alone in a long-term care institution.
The boundaries between oneself and others, either workers or other residents,
have to be constantly renegotiated. Again, this aspect of institutional care
continually reinscribes the not-home. An individual has to somehow carve out
a space of homelikeness amid the constant pressures of becoming an institu-
tionalized object of care.



F r agments of H ome
In conclusion, despite the best intentions of regulators, there are many ways in
which the idea of home is disturbed. First, quite obviously, when a partner has
to be institutionalized, home is no longer a single place. I had to negotiate my
home without my husband and this other place where he was living. However,
this other location is also a place where people work and other people live. It is
an odd living arrangement, and it is difficult to understand one’s place within
such a setting. I could attempt to see myself as giving some care or partici-
pating in my husband’s care, but it became apparent that I could not really
relate to the people who were caring for my husband as co-caregivers. I was
seen as a family member that made demands. I was like a boss in a way and
was often perceived as a hindrance to the care practices that were in place. I was
a disturbance; my mere presence needed to be accommodated, and not every
worker felt particularly good about that.



12 | It is not that care workers do not care; they are simply not given the time to care.
For a discussion of nursing-home workers, see Diamond. Although dating from 1992,
this book is still relevant and remains a lasting contribution to the understanding of
care work.

         As a family member of someone living in long-term care, I have become
     particularly aware of the manner in which the trope of home functions as a way
     to remind me that my husband is living in an alternative homelike space. This
     space is provided as a way of humanizing his care, but it remains fragmented
     and ultimately inauthentic. If some pieces of homelikeness can be recuperated,
     the apparatus of institutional care can, in turn, easily dissipate them. This can
     only result in a continuous shift between home and not-home. In addition, the
     institutional care he receives is regulated in a way that reinscribes his body as
     disabled and as Other, especially since he is cognitively impaired. Because he
     cannot voice his needs, he is taken to be apathetic and uncommunicative. This
     means that he is physically repositioned at set times. His caregivers do not
     feel they need to engage him; they can get away with entering his room and
     mechanically providing care. The flow of his daily life is punctuated by care
     provision that arrives at a set time and not according to his needs. Within an
     institutional setting, even if it purports to be homelike, this acts as an indicator
     that one is an object, rather than a subject, of care.
         Institutional interruptions become the norm in a facsimile of home.
     The daily activities of care continually reinscribe the “not-home” within the
     living environment. Because the focus on “homelikeness” targets the physical
     surroundings of long-term care institutions and not the manner in which
     workers interact with residents, those institutions cannot be “homelike” and
     much less a “home.” Likeness cannot be produced and maintained by the
     physical environment alone; it should be inscribed in the practices of care.
     Therefore, to be at home should be embodied in these practices of care, which
     in turn support the flow of daily living and do not merely serve to disrupt it.

A Place for Dad
One Family’s Experience of For-Profit Care

Amanda Barusch

                              I’m having a hard time manufacturing words right now.



Those were the first words Dad spoke to me over the phone when he found
himself heavily sedated and physically restrained in the local Intensive Care
Unit (ICU). He sounded drunk.
    My father was diagnosed with probable Alzheimer’s in 2007. He was 83
years old and had lived for the past 30 years or so on five hilly acres in a “quar-
ter-million-dollar-fixer-upper” in Northern California with his second wife, my
step-mother, Catherine.1 Like many who receive the diagnosis, Dad’s cognitive
difficulties crept up on him. Never terribly precise, Dad’s stories became even
more vague and inconsistent. Then he developed “sundowning syndrome.”
Common among people with cognitive impairment, sundowning describes
the exacerbation of symptoms in late afternoon or evening (Khachiyants et al.).
Catherine noticed that Dad didn’t know who she was when they sat down to
dinner. He wouldn’t ask her name outright but pestered her with questions:
“Where are you from?” “Are you married?” By the next morning, the problem
was gone.
    Later, the loss of names and identities became more pervasive. Once I called
the house while my brother was visiting. Dad took the phone into the bedroom
and whispered, There’s some guy staying here. I can’t figure out who he is. So, I
go through the waste paper in his room when he’s not around. I think I’ll find an
envelope addressed to him and figure out his name. Dad’s cognitive difficulties
were more severe than I’d thought, but I marveled at his clever coping strategy.
    Linda Clare examined the coping strategies of 12 older adults in the early
stages of Alzheimer’s. She described the tension between “developing a fighting
spirit” and “coming to terms” (139). In Dad’s relationship with Catherine he
provided the fighting spirit. She managed the coming to terms: setting up a

1 | All names used here are pseudonyms.
54   Amanda Barusch


     strict regimen of vitamins and supplements designed to forestall the inevitable,
     removing the knobs from the stove controls so he couldn’t burn the place up,
     cutting off electricity to the power tools in his workshop, hiding the keys to the
     car.
          The tension between these two positions played out in their relationship.
     After my brother’s stay, I went for a visit. Dad pulled me outside to their deck,
     overlooking a dry California meadow. He said, You know … the funniest thing … I
     used to be married to a woman with exactly the same name as that one in there. But
     the one I was married to was younger and prettier. I laughed, “Dad, you’d better
     not tell this one about the other one,” and tried to persuade him that he was
     actually married to “that one in there.”
          Catherine’s emails were peppered with reports of Dad’s misbehavior. She
     brought in a live-in male caregiver, but Dad didn’t like the guy. He called him
     Stan the man, swore at him, and threatened to key his car. I figured Dad was
     jealous. Then one day he picked up a two-by-four and chased Stan off the
     property. I came to dread emails with the subject line, “Your Father.”
          Catherine arranged a trip to Sedona, a town in Arizona they both enjoyed
     visiting. But the day before they were scheduled to leave, she wrote,

     Your dad begged me in tears to cancel the trip. He said he knew he was an old man and
     he wanted to spend all of his remaining days right here, in a place he loves, with the
     cats …

     So the trip was cancelled.
         Catherine hired a daytime caregiver, a woman named Marilyn, whom she
     located through Senior Network Services, a non-profit “community resource
     agency” that relies primarily on government funding provided under the Older
     Americans Act. Senior Network Services maintained a registry of home-help
     providers who had passed criminal background checks. Marilyn had recently
     lost her best friend to Alzheimer’s and knew how to manage dementia.
         Still, as I told my friends, “Early Alzheimer’s is not that bad!” Catherine
     and I marveled that my Dad, who had accumulated more than his share of
     resentments in life, had forgotten all about them. He was gregarious and more
     pleasant than ever. Three years after diagnosis, Catherine was still coping fairly
     well. Marilyn came on weekdays to take Dad to appointments and exercise
     classes, and Catherine was even able to get some work done. In August of 2010
     she reported,

     We just adopted two 5-month-old tiger kitties from the collection at the Farmer’s
     Market. They’re litter mates, one male and one female. I think their names will be Mickey
     and Mocha. Lively little critters … Ten days later, One kitty’s name didn’t stick. Your
                                                                           A Place for Dad     55


Dad calls the little female “Spider,” so I guess that’s her name. Mickey is sometimes
“Monkey,” so maybe that’s his name. Or Mickey the Monkey.

The last weekend in September, Catherine asked me to keep Dad busy so she
could get some things done. He and I set out to plant some tired-looking bay
trees that Catherine got for free from a nursery. We hauled trees and water up
the hill in a wheelbarrow. I dug holes with the old post-hole digger while Dad
watched and gave the same instructions he’d given 40 years before when we
built a corral for our new goat. Dad set up a drip irrigation system so the trees
would survive those dry autumn days.
    The following week I was scheduled to teach a workshop in New Zealand.
At San Francisco International Airport I checked my email to find a message
from Catherine:

Your Dad: An Update
Early this morning your Dad fell after getting out of bed … I was in the other room and
heard the crash. He was on the floor, breathing but unresponsive for a while, then did
come around. I called the paramedics to come and lift him back into bed. He complained
of a fierce headache, so I think he hit his head when he fell.
Later this morning Marilyn took him to Urgent Care to get a prescription for cough
medicine (they wouldn’t prescribe without seeing him again). Dr. Kim at Urgent Care
said your Dad has worsening pneumonia, worsening mental state, lower oxygen level.
Also, he is very unsteady on his feet, and has to be assisted to walk. This is all so unlike
your Dad!

Only a few days before, Dad was hauling water up the hill and playing with
his cats. Now he was being assessed for hospice care. Catherine did not plan to
treat the pneumonia because Dad had signed an advance directive requesting
that no heroic measures be used to save his life. “But,” I said, “antibiotics are
not heroic measures!” “Oh yes, they are.” Catherine had shown me the directive
when Dad was initially diagnosed. I even read it. But, contrary to the advice of
experts (Brown), we never really discussed its implications. This set us up for
a difficult conversation that culminated in Catherine saying, “Amanda, you are
in denial. Your father is dying.” My brother Daniel and my husband Lucas both
agreed with her. So I got on the plane, fully expecting to be summoned back by
my father’s death. But Dad didn’t die. He didn’t even have pneumonia. Or, if he
did, it must have been viral. No. Dad rallied, but his abilities were diminished.
Catherine wrote:

Turns out your Dad’s cognition took a serious hit. He can no longer find the bathroom by
himself … At midnight last night he got up and was wandering around the house in his
pajamas. He was carrying a pair of shorts in one hand and my watch in the other hand.
56   Amanda Barusch


     He said he needed to poop … I led him to the bathroom, and waited for him, to guide him
     back to bed. But somehow he must have forgotten how to use the toilet, and apparently
     didn’t pull down his pajama bottoms. So he dropped a large loose load in his pajamas
     and also urinated through them into the toilet. He wasn’t aware he had done any of
     that … I’m seriously thinking placement.

     Dad’s cognition improved a bit, but as winter approached Catherine devel-
     oped severe colitis, which her naturopath told her was stress-related. Then she
     tripped over one of the cats and broke her foot. Later, she explained that with
     these two events she “permanently lost the ability to pursue two of my major
     interests: hiking and cooking.”
         Dad’s problems with incontinence continued, and his outbursts became
     more frequent. As an academic gerontologist, I knew the predictors of insti-
     tutional placement: cognitive difficulties (particularly when accompanied by
     angry outbursts), lower functional capacity (particularly incontinence), and
     caregiver burden (Haupt and Kurz; Luppa et al.; Rozzini et al.). I set out to find
     a geriatric care manager who could help us make tough decisions.
         Care managers are not licensed in the United States, but a non-profit associ-
     ation (NGO) called the National Association of Professional Geriatric Managers
     (now Aging Life Care Association) provides certification and maintains an
     online directory of its members. That’s where I found Sharon Kenway, a regis-
     tered nurse and certified care manager, who held an “advanced professional”
     membership in the association. Sharon did a complete assessment of Dad’s
     status and facilitated several pleasant family conference calls that led to clarifi-
     cation of issues, but no decisions.



     D ecision
     Rather than place Dad in a facility permanently, Catherine decided to seek a
     temporary respite placement for a couple of weeks. Sharon recommended an
     assisted-living facility called Munio:

     If you are open to talking with Rachelle at Munio, it might be a good place to look and
     have a conversation so you then have a good idea of some of the special care opportu-
     nities to look for in the other care homes. Munio is a leader in memory care and Rachelle
     is well respected and has been in her position for an extended amount of time. I told her
     you might be calling.

     But Catherine wanted to send Dad to Marilyn’s home for a while. Dad had an
     excellent relationship with Marilyn and it was difficult to arrange for the TB test
     required by licensed facilities. Sharon did not approve:
                                                                           A Place for Dad      57


I’m not saying that you cannot choose to do this, but I caution you to look closely. Is
Marilyn available 24 hours/day and prepared for any confusion at night? Do you know
that the meals are prepared appropriately, I would much prefer that you consider having
Marilyn go with [Dad] to a licensed board and care home or assisted living facility ...
there ... you know that bathrooms are safe for him and that he has appropriate sleeping
arrangements.

So Dad moved in with Marilyn and her husband, and Catherine cut off commu-
nication with Sharon. This was the second time Catherine and I had disagreed
about Dad’s care (the first being on the question of antibiotics for his pneu-
monia). Despite our gratitude and affection for Catherine, I found it difficult
to accept that as Dad’s wife and as the first person listed on his medical power
of attorney, she was in charge. Perhaps sensing my disapproval, Catherine
advised me of her decision after the fact:

Subject: Your Dad is Asking About You
Your Dad is staying with Marilyn for a few days while I get some projects taken care of
here. She says he would like to hear from you, just to know that someone is “checking
up” on him (he thinks I’m away for a few days). So, if you get a chance, Marilyn’s cell
number is …
Thanks.

Initially, the arrangement worked well. Dad was cheerful and focused during
our daily phone calls. He got along with Marilyn’s husband, and Marilyn didn’t
mind his getting up in the night. At least that’s what she said. Catherine enjoyed
having the house to herself and catching up on her sleep. Then, one night, Dad
decided to walk home. This was not uncharacteristic. He often took long walks
through the hills of his neighborhood. But this wasn’t his neighborhood. A
rescue squad located Dad a few miles from Marilyn’s house and brought him
back perfectly cheerful and healthy.
    Dad returned home and was there for eight months before Catherine once
more needed respite. During this time, Catherine wrote:

As summer wanes the flowering plants on the deck bloom less. I do more deadheading
to try to prolong their blooming, and I rejoice in the occasional late burst of color. But
it all feels a tiny bit desperate and ultimately futile. Caring for your dad brings a similar
feeling of desperation and futility, and also a similar rejoicing in any small sign of
normality, of reblooming. Then I wonder if I am just interfering with nature’s course, if I
am out of step with the rumbling universe.

She described her conundrum as Dad’s “care partner:”
58   Amanda Barusch


     The more I do to support your Dad’s happiness and health and cognition, the longer I
     delay his inevitable decline; and the longer I delay his inevitable decline, the worse toll it
     takes on my health and wellbeing. Yet, emotionally and morally I cannot, and will not, do
     otherwise. This is my path, and I need to find a way to follow it with grace. I feel caught
     between a rock and a hard place, and it has been tearing me apart.

     Catherine arranged to attend a week-long retreat in a nearby community. My
     brother and I would stay with Dad, and Marilyn would be available to help us
     during the day. As time for her departure drew near, Catherine prepared a
     40-page book of instructions and emailed periodic addenda:

     Oh, and one other thing: the coffeemaker is history. Twice your Dad almost started a
     fire with the carafe, so it’s too dangerous to have around. You’ll have to make do with
     manual drip, a la barista.

     Our week with Dad was uneventful. We had coffee in the morning, walked
     down to pick up the paper, played with the cats, puttered in the yard. Dad and
     Daniel talked, and I took notes. We went out for ice cream and Dad remem-
     bered Catherine’s birthday – sort of: September 27 … that’s somebody’s birthday.
     So we bought a card. Nights were disrupted by the motion-sensitive alarm in
     the bedroom, which buzzed whenever dad left the bed or a cat walked by.
         Several months later, when Catherine decided to go on another retreat, she
     asked Marilyn to stay with Dad. This retreat was not so restful, as Catherine
     wrote:

     What happened that triggered the colitis was that the Sunday before I was to go [on
     retreat] your Dad experienced what seemed almost like a psychotic break. We were
     without electricity most of that rainy day, so our normal routine was off … He was unusu-
     ally irritable at dinner, wouldn’t take his supplements, and I made the mistake of arguing
     with him about it. Whereupon he collapsed on the table with wracking sobs, saying he
     was lost. The rest of the evening he varied between loud anger at me and such devas-
     tating unhappiness that at one point he collapsed in my arms and I had to lower him
     to the floor. So the whole time I was away I worried about him.

     Catherine put Dad on the waiting lists of several assisted living facilities (they
     are called Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly or RCFEs in California)
     that met her criteria: activities to keep Dad busy, a pleasant setting that was
     convenient to their home, and the availability of organic food (though she even-
     tually compromised on the food). Munio was not among them. Two weeks
     later, a room became available at a nearby facility, and Catherine put down her
     deposit. She was required to furnish the room and provide linens and blankets.
                                                                       A Place for Dad    59


Dad would need a TB test, and Marilyn would take him over there. Catherine
expected a smooth transition:

When we visited there today your Dad seemed to have a good time chatting up the old
ladies, and they gave him ice cream after lunch, so he was a happy camper. I think this
transition is going to be harder on me than on him.



C onte x t
The United States is sometimes described as having not one, but fifty different
health-care systems. It might be more accurate to describe it as a “blended”
health-care system, in which federal and state governments interact with the
private market. Our residential care system includes very few facilities that are
operated directly by the government.
    This was not the case prior to 1935 (when Dad was 11 years old). Almshouses,
largely populated with older adults, were funded and operated by local govern-
ments. Charitable groups, eager to ensure that their own elders never had to
live in these wretched facilities, established small private facilities that were
more like what we now know as group homes – small residences with 16 to 20
older adults. Although the quality of almshouses was improving, the federal
government sought to encourage private facilities, and in the 1920s it prohib-
ited payment of Old Age Assistance (OAA) to residents of public almshouses.
These payments were available to residents of private homes, however; and
many of these added nursing staff and call themselves “a private home with
infirmary.” The 1935 Social Security Act continued this tradition, and a private
nursing-home industry grew up with minimal government regulation (Schell).
With the 1965 advent of Medicare and Medicaid funding, the industry grew
exponentially.
    But there were growing concerns about the quality of care provided by these
nursing homes, and in 1987, Title IV of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act (OBRA) instituted sweeping reforms. In order to receive payments from
Medicare or Medicaid, nursing homes were required to meet federal require-
ments, including:

•   uniform certification standards, a revised inspection process, and expanded
    sanctions for noncompliance;
•   regular evaluation of residents and formal care plans;
•   staffing levels for nursing services, social services, rehabilitation, pharma-
    ceutical care, dietary services, and a full-time social worker; and
•   competency evaluation and a minimum of 75 hours of training for nursing
    aides.
60   Amanda Barusch


     In addition, the law established rights of nursing-home residents to:

     •   remain in the nursing home (except in cases of non-payment, dangerous
         behaviors, or significant changes in medical condition);
     •   be free from abuse, mistreatment, and neglect;
     •   choose a personal physician and access medical records;
     •   be free of unnecessary physical and chemical restraints;
     •   manage their own financial matters; and
     •   receive visitors and access a private telephone. (Wiener et al.)

     The subsequent title of OBRA addressed energy regulations, and a compar-
     ison of the two led some to observe that, in the United States, nursing homes
     are regulated more strictly than nuclear power plants (Franklin). Later those
     regulations were expanded and clarified by additional legislation, which set the
     stage for assisted-living facilities.



     The R ise of A ssisted L iving F acilities
     In the 1990s, growing concern about the over-medicalization (and the high
     cost) of nursing homes led U.S. gerontologists to advocate for the expansion of
     community-based alternatives to establish a “continuum of care.” Then along
     came assisted-living facilities. These alternatives to nursing homes expanded
     rapidly during the 1990s, particularly in the West, where they were widely touted
     as the “new model of long-term care” that “dazzled with its promise” (Hawes
     et al. 1; Wilson 18). Indeed, the California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform
     (CANHR) reported that “over the past twenty years, residential care/assisted
     living has become the fastest growing component of long-term care” (CANHR 3).
         Assisted-living facilities were (at least in theory) “designed to accommodate
     individual residents’ changing needs and preferences; designed to maximize
     residents’ dignity, autonomy, privacy, independence, and safety; and designed
     to encourage family and community involvement” (Assisted Living Quality
     Coalition 4). They cater to “private pay” residents, who do not rely on the federal
     subsidies available through Medicare and Medicaid; therefore, they are not
     subject to federal regulations associated with those subsidies. Instead, they are
     defined, licensed, and regulated by the states.
         In 2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported
     that there were 15,600 nursing homes in the United States, of which most (70
     per cent) were owned and operated by for-profit organizations, 24 per cent by
     non-profits, and 6 per cent by government and other entities. At the same time,
     there were about 30,200 assisted-living and similar residential communities,
     housing one million residents. Among them, 82 per cent were for-profit, 17 per
                                                                  A Place for Dad    61


cent non-profit, and one per cent government and other entities (CDC 2015).
Whereas 16 per cent of nursing homes were located in the West, 42 per cent of
residential care communities were located there; and the vast majority of both
were located in major metropolitan areas. A minority of both nursing homes (15
per cent) and residential-care facilities (12 per cent) operated separate demen-
tia-care units.
    In the absence of nationally agreed upon definitions and standards for
assisted-living facilities, conditions vary. California, with more assisted-living
facilities (or RCFEs) than any other state, uses this definition: “a voluntarily
chosen housing arrangement where residents are 60 years of age or older and
where varying levels of care and supervision are provided, as agreed to at the
time of admission or as determined at subsequent times of reappraisal.” (U.S.
Department of Health & Human Services, 1998)
    In 2013 there were 7,500 licensed RCFEs in California, serving over 174,000
people. The vast majority (over 90 per cent) were owned and operated for profit,
and most had six or fewer beds (CANHR). The licensing regulations for these
facilities are 28 pages long; Mississippi’s, by contrast, take only four pages.
They specifically prohibit admission of someone with “active communicable
tuberculosis” (hence the dreaded TB test). Facilities are allowed to issue 30-day
eviction notices for nonpayment or failure to comply with facility policies, or
if the resident has a need that was not previously identified. Further, assess-
ment is required to address functional capacity, mental condition, and social
factors. Admission of persons with dementia requires annual medical assess-
ment, adequate supervision, enhanced physical-plant safety requirements, and
an appropriate activity program.
    The state also specifies training requirements for administrators and direct
service staff. Those who provide direct care with Activities of Daily Living must
receive at least 40 hours of documented training in their first month and 20
hours per year thereafter. Staff who help with administration of medication
must complete 10 hours of initial training in smaller facilities and 24 hours
in those with 16 or more residents. These staff are required to complete eight
hours of annual training in subsequent years (NCAL State Regulatory Review).
As a comparison, in California, nail technicians are required to complete 400
hours of training before they are licensed (California Board of Cosmetology
Licensing Requirements).



M oving D ay
Dad moved into a small RCFE called “Casa de la Felicidad,” on 11 January 2012.
Tai, the owner of the facility, encouraged Catherine to tell Dad an acceptable
fiction that would explain the move:
62   Amanda Barusch


     I’ll tell your Dad that we have to have the house tented for termites, so we all have to
     vacate for a few days. Marilyn will tell him he can’t stay with her because her mother is
     visiting. And I’ll tell him that I will be taking the cats with me to stay at a friend’s house.
     That’s our story! If you talk with your Dad before he moves, please keep it in mind. This
     weekend we are doing some heart-wrenching “lasts,” though of course he doesn’t know
     that.

     Tai also advised her to stay away for a couple of weeks, so Dad could adjust.
     Apparently, this is fairly common advice in “the industry.” After moving day,
     Catherine wrote:

     Amanda, it was more difficult than I anticipated. He hated the place, disliked the
     people, and resented having no choice in the matter, even though we said it was only
     for a few days “while the house is tented for termites.” Seemed to me there were more
     high-functioning residents there, and more staff, when we visited before. I came away
     thinking I’d made a huge mistake … I couldn’t stand for your Dad to be miserable there,
     and if that’s what happens, we’ll have to make some changes.
     Now I must enter withdrawal. Your Dad anchored my life, the last few years took it over
     completely. Now I am adrift, with no clear idea who I am any more. Close friends have
     moved away, or distanced themselves in other ways. For so long I have been mainly
     the dispenser of pills, the provider of meals, the meeter of needs, the foil to your Dad’s
     remaining and repetitive attempts at repartee. What now? An empty house, a sore
     heart, only kitties to feed, no one to hold me while I weep. I’ll get through it, but please
     keep me in your thoughts tonight.

     A few days later, things were “so far, so good.” Marilyn visited Dad on weekdays
     and he seemed to benefit from the continuity. The manager of the facility said
     it was alright for me to visit, but not Catherine. Less than two weeks after Dad
     moved in, Catherine wrote:

     Amanda, this rollercoaster is driving me crazy. Every day I get a call from Tai about your
     Dad’s bad behavior, then later I get a call from Marilyn about what a good day he had!
     Tonight I got a second call from Tai, and he does want your Dad out of Casa de la Feli-
     cidad, because he frightens the staff. Tai gave me the name and number of a reloca-
     tion specialist who found an appropriate place for the last resident they kicked out (the
     one whose room your Dad was waiting for). Her name is Betsy Sheehan, and her phone
     number is … Tai encouraged me to involve her to make sure we get the best fit for your
     Dad, which might or might not be Munio. I called her number and left a message.

     Tai said Dad had removed his leather belt and threatened the staff with it. Cath-
     erine explained that:
                                                                          A Place for Dad     63


Apparently he had fallen asleep in the living room, and they were trying to get him to get
up and go to bed. They locked themselves in the kitchen and called the owner, who came
and calmed your Dad down, then called me.

I imagine Dad was growling. He used to slowly take off his belt and growl at
us when we were kids. But he never, ever hit us. Dad was a small, wiry man.
But the aids were smaller, softer, Latina women. He could have scared them.
And, given Marilyn’s calming presence, it’s entirely possible that he had a good
day while she was there and behaved badly when she was not. My response to
Catherine:

Yes, it does sound maddening. Bottom line is they want him out … I’d like to know what
Betsy Sheehan’s background is, and who pays her. Apart from that I guess ideas are
welcome – confusion’s not. We have plenty of that!
It’ll work out – and I do think we’ll be able to get Dad settled and reasonably happy even-
tually... he might outlive us all! See you Saturday.

And so it went. Tai said Dad was trying to jump over the fence and escape.
Marilyn said he was just inspecting the fence and didn’t try to go over it. She
saw Dad as a happy camper and Tai saw him as “combative.” Tai nagged Cath-
erine daily. He wanted Dad on an anti-psychotic called Seroquel, but Catherine
learned it was contra-indicated for people with dementia. She hated to see
him drugged, and said, “Here we go, ‘chemical restraint.’” But soon he was
on Seroquel and Tai was urging increased dosages. I called the long-term care
ombudsman, who told me dad had a right to 30 days’ notice. Then I called Betsy
Sheehan, and reported back to Catherine:

She refused to give me references or a list of facilities she uses and has no training in
elder care. She’s a marketing person who gets a finder’s fee [The receiving facility pays
her half of one month’s rent, about $ 4,500.] if she places him, regardless of how long
he stays there …

Against all advice, Catherine began to consider taking Dad back home. She
spent an hour on the phone with Betsy and found her “very helpful.” Betsy
explained that Tai can “get emotional at times.” Ultimately, Tai threatened to
call 911, and told Catherine that would make Dad “very hard to place.” Betsy
suggested a facility called Crescent Lodge, which was over an hour’s drive from
home during those rare times when there was no traffic. I wondered whether
Tai would get a kickback if she placed him there. I made an appointment with
Rachelle (whom Sharon had recommended), and she agreed to go to Casa de la
Felicidad and do an assessment of Dad. I called the Veterans’ Administration’s
64   Amanda Barusch


     Extended Care Liaison to see what help they could give (none). Within hours, I
     received an email from Catherine:

     Subject: I’m picking up your Dad tomorrow.
     Tai called tonight to say your Dad was threatening the resident in the next room. I can’t
     take any more of this so I’m going to go get him tomorrow.



     H ome
     So Catherine took Dad home. She engaged his night caregiver to stay with him.
     The next morning, she wrote:

     Your Dad seemed fine when I brought him home, we had a pleasant evening. But then
     in the middle of the night he became violent, and threatened both me and the caregiver
     with anything he could find to use for a weapon. At one point he tried to strangle me.
     [He also threw an Adirondack chair at her and was roving through the house looking for
     weapons when she called the sheriff.] It was like he was in a trance. He has never offered
     me violence before. I had to call 911, and now he’s in the ICU at Dominican Hospital for
     safety.

     I sent a message to my brother, “All hell has officially broken loose.” I spent the
     rest of the day on the phone. Dad was in physical restraints in the Intensive
     Care Unit. They had put him on Haldol and expected to move him to the
     Medical-Surgery Ward. I jotted phone numbers, suggestions, questions and
     misspelled drug names in my journal:
          5:30: Esther – napped a couple of hours, switched from Seraquel to Zyprex,
     olanzapine … Catherine – Dad’s still in restraints … Seraquil? Geodon? Treat-
     ment plan? Zyprexa? No medical issue. Unstable. Restraints. Social worker: Do
     not let them discharge him to you. Must refer to psych. When will he be stable?
     Fran 6:15: Pleasant in AM, restraints in PM. Came in as observation patient.
     Social Worker: Medicare may refuse to pay. Look at RCF not SNF. Family must
     do that. How long? 24 hours. He has to be stable. Talk with nurse @ revers-
     ibility. 2nd opinion. Delerium, temporary condition, Infection?? On Diproxin
     now. Dr. Wilson: Great this morning. Medicine takes the edge off but can’t
     help with the real challenges. Needs 24 hr. care. Meds help stay calm and not
     wander. Will get harder and harder until something else takes him.
          The journal also has a long list of facilities and a note: “Rachelle at Munio
     says no. He’s too fit.” And a quote from Betsy Sheehan, “I feel your pain.”
     I called the hospital before getting on the flight from Salt Lake to San Jose:
     10AM: He’s in critical care, nurses station “waiting for bed to open” – Urinary
                                                                            A Place for Dad     65


infection – urinalysis fine, clear, Order says to be discharged today. Dr. Chris-
tianson on duty, call Ella in 45 minutes.

An email arrived from Catherine:

Subject: Your Dad is going to Crescent Lodge.
He’ll be going there in his pajamas. I think I’ll take a suitcase over to the hospital in the
morning, and see if the social worker can make sure it goes with him.

While I was in the air, Dad was transported to Crescent Lodge. I arrived at the
facility less than an hour after he did. Dad was in a large private room with a
small twin bed and a separate bathroom with sink and toilet; pale and tired, but
he wasn’t in pajamas. I sat down at the edge of the bed, pulled off his socks,
and rubbed his feet the way he used to rub mine while I drifted off to sleep.
After I left, an aide called Catherine to say Dad had fallen in the hall and they
wanted to know if they should take him to the emergency room. She said, “No.”
The next morning, I asked the administrator to please not bother Catherine.
She said they had to call someone, so I gave them my cell number. For the next
few days I got a call from a different staff person every night around 10pm.
Either Dad was combative and they wanted permission to sedate him or he had
fallen and they wanted to know whether they should take him to the Emergency
Room.
    The facility referred us to a doctor who served other residents, Ivanna
Yeltsin. I sent Catherine an update:

Subject: Dad
It’s hard to say how dad is. In a lucid moment yesterday he was talking about suicide
and worrying about the tax bill when he died. Then he wanted to ask Helen [his deceased
first wife] something and was distracted by ants he saw crawling across the carpet in his
room. He complained of pain in his left knee, but didn’t seem to remember the scrape
he got on his elbow. He tired easily, but couldn’t settle. Up and down, changing chairs
(which was difficult because he has a hard time sitting down). He’s weaker than he was
on Saturday... It’s hard to say what is meds, what is the challenge of adjusting to a new
setting and what is grief and anger.
He’s surrounded by people he doesn’t know, some of whom act bizarrely. Dad tries
to make conversation but most of them don’t respond … So he retreats into silence.
There’s a woman who shouts “honey!” whenever she spots a staff person. There’s
another with scary facial twitches who tries to talk but can’t be understood. There’s a
Vietnam veteran named Jerry who talks a lot and sometimes makes sense. It’s tempting
to interact with him because he seems capable, but he doesn’t always respond. I think a
couple of the women have potential. One was throwing a bean bag from her chair during
afternoon activity.
66   Amanda Barusch


     The staff vary. Roland, the guy from the Phillipines, is my favorite. He has a nice smile,
     seems kind and is alert to the needs of residents. There’s a lovely black woman who likes
     to dance, but she seems to be assigned to only one or two of the residents. She doesn’t
     circulate. There’s Rico, a big guy with a grim expression. Chris is nice. Julie took care of
     Dad his first night, but I never saw her again. She’s Asian and has a strong accent but a
     good vibe. They wear gloves when they serve food or touch the residents.
     I ate two meals there today – the food is high on carbs, bland, low on fiber [hence the
     near-universal use of stool softeners] and (I imagine) vitamins. Dad enjoyed the ice
     cream dessert and the first night ate four servings. I bought him some fruit salads [at a
     nearby grocery] which he seemed to enjoy.

     In my journal, I wrote some quotes from Dad:

     I’m in the middle of the jungle. It’s so loud and there’s no real leader.
     I need to get out of here pretty soon.

     The administrator asked me to keep my visits short because Dad became
     disruptive after I left. She told Catherine to stay away for at least two weeks
     to give Dad a chance to “connect to the place without too many reminders of
     home.” (Later, Catherine put a stuffed cat and some family photos in his room,
     but he didn’t seem to notice.) I found it wrenching to leave him there. I’d linger,
     waiting for him to fall asleep after lunch. Then I’d sneak out, so discombolu-
     tated that I forgot the code to unlock the exit and had to wait for a staff person to
     come let me out. While I stood staring at the wall, I told myself that Alzheimer’s
     was contagious.
         I didn’t like Crescent Lodge. It didn’t smell, but it was loud, especially
     when the activities director was using her microphone. The social spaces were
     small and crowded, and the staff were stressed out. Apart from a front lawn
     that residents couldn’t access, there was no grass, just a concrete patio with a
     few container plants. Most of the residents were more demented and/or more
     disabled than Dad. Each day when I left Crescent Lodge, I went searching for a
     better option. Maple Creek had more space and less debilitated residents. It was
     quiet, but not better enough to merit the stress of moving. I wrote Catherine
     about my visit to Bayside Villa, where a friend of Marilyn’s had stayed:

     There I met Russ – a friend of Steve’s. Steve is the owner at Crescent Lodge. I saw him
     there twice. The first time he explained to me that I should not hope for my dad to improve
     because he had Alzheimer’s. The second time he walked past me as if I weren’t there.
     There’s a lot of that. I guess it’s what people do when [they] have nothing in common but
     decrepitude. Bayside Villa was pretty awful, which made it easier to go back to Crescent
     Lodge and see Dad.
                                                                             A Place for Dad      67


This is a strange industry, in part because those who work in it refer to it as “the industry.”
Russ and Steve both run what look to be mid-tier, old-style facilities. They face heavy
competition from [newer] places like Maple Creek, which charges about the same rates.
Of course, Russ and Steve have vacancies – Maple Creek doesn’t. At least not now. So
no wonder the old guys are nervous.

As I searched, I learned more about the industry. For instance, the base rate
of $ 9,000 per month is not the only charge. You pay extra for continence
and dementia care, for transportation, for medical equipment, for oxygen, for
special dietary needs, and so on. You never know what the bill might come to
in any given month, so you’d better keep a credit card handy. But Dad adjusted
quickly. As I told Catherine:

On Saturday I would have said Dad did not belong at Crescent Lodge. When I saw him
Wednesday I would have said he was incapable of living outside a facility of this kind.
Now, he seems to be settling in – adjusting his behavior to its ambience. This is clearly
easier for the staff, and probably for him, as well. He’s safely warehoused and, as Bill
[the owner] explained, there’s not a lot to hope for.

I puzzled over the lack of a care plan. I wondered what it would take to get Dad a
morning newspaper, whether he could take care of a few plants. I talked with a
nurse who attributed Dad’s agitation to my presence. Seems they had “another
guy” who showed agitation until they reduced family visits. I explained that
Dad had no family visits over the weekend, and yet last night he was more
agitated than ever. I asked why Dad was taking Zyprexa, which is contra-indi-
cated because it causes elevated risk of stroke. She said, “A lot of doctors don’t
like to prescribe Zyprexa,” and suggested that Dr. Yeltsin might wean Dad off it.
Then the driver arrived to transport Dad to Dr. Yeltsin’s office. When I called to
ask the doctor to begin weaning Dad off the Zyprexa, the woman who answered
the phone said the doctor had just left to go to Crescent Lodge to go see Dad. I
said that was unfortunate because Dad had just left Crescent Lodge to go see
her. The woman came back to say Dr. Yeltsin was actually in the exam room
with Dad.
     When I finally got the doctor on the phone, her first question was “Why is he
taking Lithium? I never prescribed Lithium!” I had no idea, but I gathered she
was concerned about medication interaction with the Lorazepam. She wanted
him to go on Depokote and just take Zyprexa at bed time and as needed. She
said Atarane was not so good. For some reason I wrote “benzodiazapene” next
to it in my journal. She asked about blood work, and I told her the hospital did
check for Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) and might have looked for other things
but I didn’t know. She agreed to “wean him down” off Zyprexa and put him
68   Amanda Barusch


     on a mood stabilizer. She gave the name, but I couldn’t understand her accent
     very well.
         During the following two weeks, I took charge of Dad’s care, so Catherine
     could get some rest. I spent as much time with him as I could, and when I
     wasn’t in the facility I searched for alternatives, studied up on pharmacology,
     and attempted to orchestrate the various providers. Marilyn was present most
     weekdays, charming staff and administrators and calming Dad. Most of the
     staff thought we were sisters. Here are some notes from my journal:

     •   Me: “How are you?” Dad: “Hoping to pass inspection.”
     •   This morning Marilyn said when she got there Dad was unresponsive. She
         could not wake him up. Staff said he was agitated and they gave him some-
         thing. He didn’t wake up at all. Liz [nurse] called doctor, said would discon-
         tinue. It’s what he took at 8 AM.
     •   Dad: “The phone’s unsatisfactory but it’ll do. It calls some places, but not
         home. 1-2-3-4 there’s quite a few people here. They’re all talking. How can
         they find things to talk about?”
     •   Last night he was up when Marilyn called. He was alert, lucid.
     •   Julie [aide]: very good today. Last night not too bad – 12–4 slept up @ 5
         picking up things from the floor
     •   Dad: “I’m going to bend their rules and go up to the mountains.”
     •   Anna [Doctor’s Admin Person] will call back when she finds medical
         records. No lab results just CBC [complete blood count].
     •   Dad: “I’m anxious to see Hawaii. It’s so cold today. I want a ticket to
         Honolulu.”
     •   Called Anna and told her about bloodwork and kidney stones. Can we have
         a conference call?
     •   Dad: “Left or right, there’s no choice. People here in California are used to
         choice.”
     •   Marilyn said a visiting nurse came in the other day and noticed red spots
         on his tummy. His left eye is red and legs are swollen. She says swelling is a
         side effect of the medications and wants him on a salt-free diet. Ointment is
         needed for dry skin and wounds, tear drops, and change laundry soap. She
         ordered a walker. Depakote, 30 mg and at lunch, Zyprexa 30 PRN. Took him
         off some because he was unresponsive. She’ll be back Wednesday.
     •   Dad: “Just saw a cat go out the door. Cat food. Got to get some good cat food.”
     •   Can’t get Dad’s shoes on because his feet are swollen.
     •   They took his belt away. Catherine ordered some elastic waist jeans.
     •   Lynne called. Walker will be delivered, but Medicare only pays 80 per cent.
         Gave my credit card for remaining balance, about $ 20.
     •   Can Dad have a private phone? What would it cost?
     •   Dad, looking at his reflection: “I have an animal in the mirror.”
                                                                   A Place for Dad    69


•   Wednesday: Lynne called and asked me to call the doctor. Dad is unusually
    sleepy. My sense is she needs help and doctor is refusing. She says we’ll find
    a quiet phone near room 19.
•   Dad: “You’ve got to dream up things to do with boats.”

I grew increasingly frustrated with Dr. Yeltsin, and one of my children
suggested I post a review on Yelp. A quotation from W.E.B. DuBois came to
mind, “We must complain. Yes, plain, blunt complaint, ceaseless agitation,
unfailing exposure of dishonesty and wrong – this is the ancient, unerring
way to liberty, and we must follow it” (621). So I gave Yeltsin 2 out of 3 stars
and wrote, “I think she’s OK face-to-face, but she doesn’t return phone calls
and doesn’t do conference calls.” The next day the doctor called Catherine and
told her she was “depleted” by my post, and that I had made trouble for her. She
would not discuss Dad’s care until I took down the post. Betsy Sheehan, the
relocation specialist, sent me an email that echoed the threat and accused me
of being “an angry woman.” “You’re damned right I’m angry!” I thought, as I
took down the post. My father was dependent on these people, so it was time to
suck up and take it. Catherine was furious with me. Her naturopath called to
tell me I was giving her unnecessary stress and I needed to be more supportive.
I was immediately relieved of responsibility for Dad’s care.
     I quit worrying about medical records, staff qualifications, and mealtime
experiences, and spent time online ordering things for Dad: a monthly fruit
basket, a plastic tool kit, puzzles designed for people with dementia, a fuzzy
hat, flannel shirts, warm socks. Lucas and I took to visiting Dad once a month
on weekends. I’d look around the room, but could never find the gifts I had
sent. We would take Dad out for seafood and beer, bring him back late – often
with his pants full – and turn him over to staff with a guilty apology. Eventually,
Dad forgot how to walk. He still could, but his mind wouldn’t tell his legs what
to do. So whenever we needed to walk somewhere I held his hands and walked
backwards just as Dad did when he taught me to dance. I repeated, “One, two,
cha-cha-cha. One, two cha-cha-cha” while other pedestrians veered out of our
way. Occasionally, and I sometimes thought surreptitiously, Marilyn would let
me know how Dad was doing. She told me, for instance, about the time he was
found passed out on the floor with low blood pressure and a slow heartbeat.
They sent him alone to the ER, and he didn’t know why he was there.
     Eventually, Crescent Lodge was sold and the quality of care deteriorated.
Dad developed frequent UTIs, and enough was enough. So Catherine moved
him to one of the places we had both visited (separately) and liked better, City
Square. It was a larger facility, with a locked dementia wing. Dad shared a room
with another man, but he seemed to enjoy that and I felt better thinking of him
less alone. On Saturdays we ran into other families and exchanged grimaces,
but not words. We were all in our own, opaque bubbles bouncing against each

     other, but seldom connecting. The place was better, but it was still hard to leave
     him.
          By the time my brother and I took Dad out to celebrate his 90th birthday,
     he was no longer walking. He had his own wheelchair. The day was sunny and
     still, so we went to a café on the beach. As usual, Dad had fish and chips, but
     this time he didn’t finish his beer. He just asked to be wheeled out onto the wet
     sand so he could feed the gulls.

     American enthusiasm for the private market is not entirely unfounded, but even
     Adam Smith, in Theory of Moral Sentiments, acknowledged that some parts of
     life must be kept safe from market influences. Capitalism can expand the pie.
     But when it does so at the expense of the vulnerable, we all suffer. The practical
     challenge for long-term care (as for other sectors in the American economy)
     is to strike an effective balance, to harness the incredible power of greed and,
     through appropriate regulation, direct it towards the good of humanity.
          In their 2013 report “Residential Care in California: Unsafe, Unregulated, &
     Unaccountable,” the CANHR attribute the incredible expansion of RCFEs in
     part to the absence of regulation. They note the increased frailty of residents
     in these facilities, and argue (as Frontline did in its 2013 documentary, “Life
     and Death in Assisted Living”) that five years ago these elders would have been
     placed in nursing homes. The CDC’s 2014 long-term care survey partially
     supports this view. For instance, it reports that a higher proportion of RCFE
     residents were 85 and over (53 per cent) than those either in nursing homes (42
     per cent) or in hospice facilities (47 per cent). But whereas half (50 per cent) of
     nursing-home residents had Alzheimer’s, only 40 per cent of RCFE residents
     did so. Likewise, 91 per cent of residents in nursing homes needed assistance
     with locomotion or walking, compared to 47 per cent in RCFEs (CDC). Perhaps
     it is more accurate to say that “some” of those in assisted living would have been
     placed in nursing homes. But the rest might, like Dad, experience significant
     declines in their functional ability during their time in residence. Certainly,
     these are among the nation’s most vulnerable.
          Our family was among the more privileged of consumers. Like Robert Kane
     (who recounts his family’s experiences in It Shouldn’t Be This Way: The Failure
     of Long-Term Care), we were well educated and possessed significant financial
     resources. Yet we struggled to get accurate and useful information to help us
     make decisions, and our experiences of care were far from ideal. We encoun-
     tered facilities that were understaffed, and staff who were undertrained and
     overworked. Despite moments of incredible kindness by some nursing aides,
     the quality of care we were able to purchase was inadequate. Our experiences
                                                                  A Place for Dad    71


also underscored an observation by the CANHR that “the chemical restraint of
RCFE residents knows no bounds. Unlicensed and barely trained aides give out
antipsychotic drugs to residents like candy, while often little or nothing is done
to respond to the underlying causes of pain, illness, despair and distress” (11).
    Clearly, the situation calls for more effective regulation. Highly prescrip-
tive regulations that limit staff initiative and divert resources from caregiving
to paperwork can be counterproductive. But stringent regulations that deter-
mine the conditions of care such as staffing and funding levels, training
requirements, and facility safeguards can support quality (cost-effective) care
(Banerjee and Armstrong; Mukamel et al.). CANHR recommends the develop-
ment of a three-tiered level of care system, with differential requirements based
on residents’ degree of disability. They advocate annual inspections, preferably
unannounced; vigorous investigation and reporting of complaints; and penal-
ties for violations.
    Families need better information as they choose from the array of long-
term care options so that they don’t have to rely on marketing personnel, private
“relocation specialists,” word of mouth, or sporadic reviews on Yelp and Google.
Long-term care ombudsmen need authorization and resources to maintain a
registry of complaints and make it publicly available.
    Finally, during Dad’s time in residential care the Affordable Care Act
passed. Tightly regulated exchanges were set up so that Americans could
purchase health insurance and know exactly what they were getting. I wrote in
my journal: “We need long-term care exchanges too.”

   Final Visit

   Dad hands me a warm rose petal,
   brown around the edges,
   whispers
   Huh. Soft. Feel that.

   A withered woman asks,
   Can you open the door for me?
   But the aide says
   No. She’s not
   allowed.

   We’ll shuffle
   out
   through a different
   door.

On Not Being Invisible
Life in a Continuing Care Retirement Community

Anne M. Wyatt-Brown


In the years that I have lived at Roland Park Place (RPP), a Continuing Care
Retirement Community (CCRC) in Baltimore, Maryland, I have created hypo­
theses about how to adjust to a place like this and subsequently been forced by
changes beyond my control to discard a good many of my initial theories. From
the moment I learned that the average age of residents here was 86, I began to
turn to my background in humanistic gerontology to help me adjust to a place
that otherwise might have seemed inappropriate for a person who was only 71.
After all, the only reason I had moved in was that my 78-year-old husband Bert
needed to be here.
     As a newcomer, I expected that there would be a period of adjustment
followed by developing a sense of belonging. I knew that some changes in my
life would then alter my feelings. After all, I assumed that I would have a big
adjustment after he died. Besides that inevitability, in time I would grow older
and become more infirm. At that point I might have to move into assisted living
or health care, a change that would force me to make another adjustment. What
I did not expect was that decisions brought about by a few managers at RPP
might alter my sense of belonging much sooner than any physical decline.



B ackground
In order to understand my reactions, it helps to know how I got interested in
humanistic gerontology in the first place and why family history encouraged us
to select RPP (Wyatt-Brown, “Once”).
    From the beginning, my interest in gerontology has included a combination
of personal and academic concerns. Initially, my experiences with older rela-
tives drew me into the field. First, in 1967, Bert’s mother had two strokes when
she was living in Sewanee, Tennessee. She loved Sewanee, the home of the
University of the South. Sewanee consisted of the college from which her sons
76   Anne M. Wyatt-Brown


     had graduated, as well as an Episcopal seminary, attended by her husband and
     Bert’s two brothers. The town, however, had no medical facilities for people who
     needed health care. As a result, Bert’s older brother, Charlie, decided to move
     their mother to Houston, Texas, where he was the rector of Palmer Memorial
     Church.
         Charlie and his wife Sheppy placed his mother in a nursing home fairly near
     their house. They did not consult her; they simply distributed the furniture to
     the children that had been designated by Mrs. Wyatt-Brown in a previous will,
     got rid of the dogs, and sold her house. As a consequence of not being consulted,
     Bert’s mother experienced some moments of depression. She missed her dogs
     and was horrified when a photograph we had sent her contained a picture of
     a piece of furniture that had belonged to her. I thought Bert’s mother needed
     therapy to help her deal with the situation, but her doctor put her on medication
     and hoped for the best. She died nine years later in December 1976.
         I learned from her unhappiness two related things. First, it can be dangerous
     to one’s sense of autonomy to try to age in place when a decline in one’s health
     makes that impossible. Second, if older people do not plan for the future, their
     children will be forced to make life-changing decisions for them. Still, when
     Mrs. Wyatt-Brown died in 1976, I was only 37, which is much too young to think
     about planning for the end of one’s life.
         Although I was too young to worry about my aging, David Van Tassel,
     Bert’s colleague in the history department at Case Western Reserve University
     (known to us as Reserve), was aware of a dramatic increase in the number of
     older people in the United States. As a result, he thought it would be important
     to encourage humanities scholars to study gerontology. Therefore, in 1975, Van
     Tassel organized a local conference on Human Values and Aging. Because the
     meetings took place at Reserve, across the street from where I was teaching at
     the Cleveland Institute of Art, I was able to attend many of the presentations.
         David invited scholars and authors who themselves were growing older and
     asked them to write about their thoughts on the subject of aging. Although
     some of them had not yet written about the topic, they gave impressive papers.
     The speakers included Leon Edel, the biographer of Henry James; Leslie
     Fiedler, a well-known literary critic; and Erik Erikson, a psychoanalyst who
     had written about stages of life but had not yet emphasized aging. I found the
     conference stimulating and informative. I was also fascinated by the work of a
     British historian, Peter Laslett, who reported that in earlier centuries, English
     rural families lived near each other, but the young members did not take their
     elders into their houses. Nonetheless, some years later he argued that the family
     members maintained close emotional ties despite living in separate dwellings.
     These essays were later published in Van Tassel’s 1979 anthology Aging, Death
     and the Completion of Being.
                                                             On Not Being Invisible    77


    Then in 1981, Van Tassel ran a month-long NEH summer institute at
Reserve, called Old Age in History and Literature, hoping to attract faculty
members in humanities to the field. My interest in aging had increased because
I had discovered the late-life novels of Barbara Pym, a British novelist who had
a 17-year hiatus in her publishing career. As a result, I welcomed the chance to
became an NEH fellow for that month. Bert said that it was like sending me to
day camp. I came back each night full of enthusiasm for the ideas to which I
was being exposed.
    Two years later, Bert and I moved to the University of Florida (UF). Thanks
to Hal Stahmer, Bert’s friend from his time at King’s College, Cambridge, who
had subsequently become a professor of religion at UF, I attended my first GSA
conference in 1983 on crutches, having recently shattered my patella. I was
allowed to create a poster rather than give a paper. Having no idea what that
entailed, I took the paper I had written and posted all six pages in the spot I was
assigned. There I met other scholars interested in the humanities and aging so
we were able to organize a panel for the following year’s meeting. In retrospect,
I am grateful that people were helpful to me rather than contemptuous of my
inexperience in the world of posters.
    Upon reflection, however, I think it’s really not surprising that I found geron-
tology to be a compatible subject. In many ways my childhood had prepared me
for my midlife interest. I had grown up in a large extended family, so I had been
exposed to several generations of aging people whose choices changed over
time. My father’s mother and his aunts had stayed in their house in Bolton Hill,
Baltimore, using household help as their health declined. This grandmother
was bedridden; she lived on the second floor while her sisters and Miss Sadie
Poe lived in the rooms on the first floor. The large house allowed the women
to create a community but to retire to privacy whenever they so desired. We
visited Granny and her sisters every Sunday after church, and Dad’s brothers
and sisters visited frequently as well. I was too young to know if loneliness was
a factor for these elderly women, but few of them complained about their lot.
When Granny died at the age of 82 in 1949, hers was the first funeral that I had
ever attended.
    In the next generation, Dad’s brothers and sisters made different choices.
First, some moved into the Wyman Court Apartments on Beech Street, quite
close to our house in Guilford. We liked to think that Dad’s siblings took over
the building. When their health declined or dementia set in, they moved to
Keswick Multi-Care Center, a few blocks away. When my Uncle Fendall died at
Keswick, his widow, Aunt Jane, moved into Broadmead, a CCRC in Cockeys-
ville. She was given a scooter, which allowed her to go anywhere she wanted to
in the building. She felt emancipated. Another family widow, Jo, moved into
Blakehurst, a Towson retirement community, when her husband died. Both
78   Anne M. Wyatt-Brown


     women enjoyed life once they no longer had to take care of sometimes difficult
     husbands.
          Mother’s family was much smaller. Her mother, my great-aunt Virginia,
     and my Aunt Anne lived first on Preston Street in a second-floor apartment.
     Then in the 1950s, Aunt Anne inherited some money from her Uncle Ken and
     bought a house on Rugby Road in Guilford right around the corner from our
     house on Warrenton Road. As a result, I could hop over the neighbor’s fence to
     visit them. I loved spending time with them because I was named for Grand-
     mother and Aunt Anne, and they made a fuss over me.
          Grandmother had a heart attack at the age of 76, and while she was not
     bedridden she didn’t leave the house after that event. The family hired a
     companion, whose company Grandmother did not like. At the end of her life,
     only Mother and my uncle visited her; we children were told that company
     would upset her. Great-aunt Virginia had died much earlier, leaving behind a
     closetful of dresses that she had never worn, my mother reported scornfully.
     Aunt Anne had a stroke many years after Grandmother’s death that made her
     housebound for ten years. My brother Luke and his wife, Nancy, were in charge
     of her when she was bedridden toward the end of her life.
          As my parents aged, we discovered that they had different ideas about how
     to spend their declining years. My mother, like many other people, wanted to
     stay in her house. Many of their older friends had aged in place, and Mother had
     followed their stories very closely. She had never lived in a community growing
     up. Her father had died when she was in eleventh grade after years of being too
     ill to work. As a result of the drain on their finances, Mother left school without
     a diploma and never went to college, where dorm life might have prepared her
     for a community existence. My father, however, wanted to make sure that she
     would be taken care of after his death. He decided that they would move into
     RPP, which at that point was very new.
          Therefore, in December 1986, my parents called a family meeting to
     announce that they would be moving into RPP in the fall of 1987. I’m assuming
     that Dad decided on that place because it was so close to the house where they
     had been living for about 50 years. Nonetheless, the move was traumatic.
     Mother wanted to keep an eye on every item when it was packed, which was of
     course impossible. Dad, on the other hand, was indifferent to most things once
     he found a good home for his books. Bert and I took many of them, an act that
     relieved his mind.
          Once they moved in, Mother had a much more difficult time than Dad did.
     Besides lacking community experience, she had glaucoma, a detached retina
     that had not healed properly, and a cataract in the one good eye. Her doctors
     didn’t want to remove her cataract, because if the operation was unsuccessful,
     she would be blind. What they didn’t realize was how her inadequate vision was
     making it nearly impossible for her to adjust to life at RPP. Unlike many resi-
                                                            On Not Being Invisible   79


dents, Mother did not tell people that she couldn’t see. As a result, she feared
that she might fail to speak to a friend if she didn’t recognize her when walking
in the building.
    To avoid being inadvertently rude, Mother spent a good deal of time in the
apartment, except when a family member came to dinner. In contrast, Dad kept
meeting people he hadn’t seen since school days. He continued to be active in
his law firm as a consultant and had dinner with many people at RPP. The ease
with which he found dinner companions was not surprising. There are many
more women than men in CCRCs, so new men are snapped up by observant
women. My sister, Susan, and I would talk to the head nurse about Mother’s
isolation, but the nurse said that some people could not be helped. Sadly, my
relatively well-adjusted father died in March 1988, whereas Mother lived alone
in the apartment until she died in 1993.



E arly D ays at R ol and Park P l ace
What the complicated family history taught me was that one of the most diffi-
cult choices of later life can be deciding where to live. My guess is that when
one is faced with the necessity of making a change, even gerontologists may not
necessarily consult the current literature, especially if circumstances dictate a
quick move. Fortunately, in 2015, Stephen Golant composed a comprehensive
study of the possible places that an older person could select, Aging in the Right
Place. He points out that it is almost impossible to avoid messages on television,
on the Internet, in books about later life, and in newspapers that insist that
the ideal is to age in place (63). In contrast, he discusses the advantages and
problems that can emerge when people try to stay in their dwellings. Instead
of selecting one kind of possible place, he covers as many alternatives as now
exist. Each alternative has advantages and disadvantages, so Golant suggests
which kind of place might appeal to different kinds of personalities. His book
is comprehensive and helpful, but unfortunately it appeared too late for us to
consult it.
    As I wrote in the first essay in The Big Move (“A Wife’s Life”), my account
of my early life at RPP, Baltimore had the worst snowstorm in its history in
2010. We decided to move into RPP because it was in the city and the place we
knew best. Initially the adjustment was not easy for me, but after a relatively
short time both Bert and I felt at home. I had worried about how I would
feel once Bert died, but by the time that happened I had made many friends
and had also made a new life for myself largely centered around the Fitness
Center. Moreover, residents and staff were extremely kind to me after his
death, which made me glad that I had decided to stay at RPP. I thought that
80   Anne M. Wyatt-Brown


     my adjustment was complete until the time when my health would begin to
     deteriorate.
         For several years, things continued to be relatively easy for me. Like many
     widows, I was very busy after Bert’s death in November 2012. For one thing, he
     had completed a book, A Warring Nation, just before he died. It was up to me
     and my sister Susan, who had helped him before his death to answer questions
     posed by the editor, to see the book through to press. Luckily, Bert and Susan
     had worked hard to answer as many of the editor’s questions as possible. Then,
     once Bert died, the number of unanswered questions was relatively small,
     and many friends helped in ways that I acknowledged in an addendum to the
     acknowledgments. The book was published by the University of Virginia Press
     early in 2014.



     A M a jor C hange at R ol and Park P l ace
     In 2014, a change occurred that was a mixture of positive and negative. It had
     to do with Stewart and Valencio, who had been running the Fitness Center
     since we had moved in. As I said earlier, taking land and swimming classes at
     the Fitness Center of RPP and hiring Stewart and Valencio as personal trainers
     had given me a sense of belonging. Then on May 15, 2014, Stewart and Valencio
     won the Maryland Department of Aging’s 7th Annual Governor’s Leadership
     in Aging Awards. They invited me to attend the meeting because I was active in
     the Fitness Center. I was delighted by their recognition because both men were
     doing a fine job working with the residents.
         That positive event was later overshadowed by a more complicated one. To
     our surprise, Stewart announced a career change. After many years at RPP, in
     2014 he decided to start working for a degree as an assistant physical therapist.
     He cut back his hours at RPP dramatically but planned to continue to work part
     time until the demands of the program made it impossible for him to continue.
     He told his boss, one of the managers, that he probably would be leaving for
     good sometime in the middle of 2015.
         In many ways Stewart’s decision to further his education had been unex-
     pected. Valencio had been working on a PhD in music education, and we all
     thought that when he completed his degree, he would leave RPP. Instead, he
     took over many of the classes that Stewart had taught. As a result, I had the
     pleasure of taking his land classes, as well as the swimming classes that he had
     taught for eight years. We all appreciated his willingness to take on extra work,
     and I enjoyed his engaging teaching style.

P roblems at R ol and Park P l ace
Unfortunately in 2015, the situation at RPP began to deteriorate. What really
caused trouble was that the manager had not tried to find a replacement for
Stewart. Therefore, when he announced that he would no longer be able to
stay at RPP, she had hired no one to teach his classes. Moreover, the manager
made an unexpected change in the structure of the Fitness Center at that time.
Both Stewart and Valencio had assumed that Valencio would take over Stew-
art’s job of being responsible for running the Center once Stewart left for good.
Instead, the manager decided to interview candidates herself, and she also
informed Valencio that he would not inherit Stewart’s role. That decision upset
Valencio as well as those of us who knew how hard he had been working for
many months to keep the programs effective. Not only had he taught most of
the classes, but also, when the swimming pool needed to be repainted in July
2014, he had done the work himself to spare RPP from the expense of hiring
the pool company instead.
     At a meeting with the Fitness Committee, to which I had been invited,
Valencio told us that he thought not having one person in charge would
interfere with the smooth running of the Center. He was, of course, correct.
Unfortunately, the manager ignored what he said. To make matters worse, she
insisted on hiring a man with little experience with older people, instead of a
woman whom Valencio preferred. Once the new man arrived, the manager
kept having private meetings with him, during which, according to him, she
encouraged him to think that he would ultimately get to run things.
     Not surprisingly, Valencio realized that he had no future at RPP. His phone
calls to the manager were not returned, and the new employee usually said
he was too busy to meet with him. Two months later, Valencio tendered his
resignation, and we had a farewell party for him. The manager promptly hired
the woman that Valencio had wanted to hire in the first place, and the two
newcomers tried to run the Center without much help from the manager, who
supposedly was supervising them. The manager had an ill mother, who lived
in Florida, a situation that made it difficult for her to observe what was going
on in the Fitness Center.
     When I looked over my entries in my calendar, I discovered that the two
new employees worked together at RPP for only seven months. At the time
their stay seemed endless, largely because we had no idea when, if ever, the
authorities would intervene. It seemed to us that no one cared what we thought,
and as a result we felt very discouraged. In consequence, my emotions began
to fluctuate as I responded to changing circumstances, just like those of Olive
Kitteridge, the eponymous protagonist of Elizabeth Strout’s 2008 novel.
     While things were in flux, I came upon an unusual article in Aging Today.
Most recent newspaper and magazine articles on aging assume that staying
82   Anne M. Wyatt-Brown


     in one’s house is the very best approach to living the last days of one’s life. In
     contrast, the article by Peggy Brick was titled “The Case for Aging in Commu-
     nity, Not in Place.” Brick insists that if one has enough money, aging at a CCRC
     is preferable to aging in place, provided that the CCRC is a Quaker establish-
     ment.
         Quaker CCRCs, Brick notes, do not hire activity directors for people in
     Independent Living. My friends and I were well aware that Broadmead, the
     Quaker place outside of Baltimore where my Aunt Jane had lived, allowed the
     residents to run things for themselves. We were also aware that Broadmead
     had far fewer trips than we did because we have Marie, a remarkable Indepen-
     dent Event Planning Coordinator, and Jennifer, her assistant, who organize our
     many outings. None of us has the time or the knowledge necessary to plan as
     many trips as Marie does. We are not against hiring staff to organize things for
     us; we just hope they will be competent and care about our wellbeing.
         Some time in January 2016, while we were trying desperately to adjust
     to the newcomers running the Fitness Center, I learned that a resident who
     had only arrived the previous March was about to move out. I heard, second
     hand from many residents, some of her reasons for leaving, but I decided that
     I needed to talk to her myself. Like most of us, I was upset that she was leaving
     largely because the upheaval in the Fitness Center had made me feel less at
     home. As it turned out, her reasons were different from what mine would have
     been. Among other things, she could not sell her house, which made the move
     overly expensive for her. Moreover, she had lived in a supportive neighbor-
     hood, with neighbors whose company she really enjoyed. She had complaints,
     some of which I agreed with. But then in passing she indicated that she was
     somewhat uncomfortable in the presence of people in wheelchairs, a sight that
     of course one cannot avoid in any CCRC. After I heard her complaint, I realized
     that her decision didn’t make me feel less at home. Of course, some people are
     unlikely to adjust to life in a place like ours. After all, as Golant has said, some
     people find that their friendships in a CCRC are more superficial than prior
     relations were. Moreover, the fit residents often avoid mixing with those who
     are frail because they “find it easier and less stressful to be more active and fully
     engaged” (329–30).
         At the end of March and in early April, things began to deteriorate in the
     Fitness Center. The male employee who had taken over my personal training
     from Valencio showed up late many times. When I learned that his wife was
     having a fourth child, I realized that a new baby would make it even more diffi-
     cult for him to show up on time for my appointments. I decided to hire Glenn,
     a personal trainer whom I had seen working with Margaret, a resident who has
     dementia. I was impressed by his kindness to her. When I told my RPP trainer
     that I was going to shift from him to Glenn, he asked me to send him an email
     explaining why I was making the change. I wrote him a long email in which I
                                                               On Not Being Invisible    83


explained all the problems that working with him entailed and sent a copy to
Katherine, who was chair of the Fitness Committee. She asked me to send my
message on to Terry Snyder, who is the CEO of RPP.
    At first, nothing happened. Then, a short time later when I flew back from
Boston where I had been attending a conference, I learned that Terry and Tracy,
the head of IT, had asked several residents to explain to them why they suppos-
edly had spoken disrespectfully about the two newcomers who were working
in the Fitness Center. The only reason that I was not interviewed was that I
had been out of town and therefore had not answered the phone call. Most of
the people who had been asked to meet with Terry and Tracy had no idea who
might have said mean things about the two newer employees. In fact, I hadn’t
even heard many complaints about the woman employee. She was working as
hard as she could to make the program work. As for the man, whenever I had a
complaint, I spoke to him directly.
    A month later in early May, the male employee who had taken time off
to help with his new baby returned to work. That day, to his surprise, he was
fired. I happened to be using the recumbent bike near his office when two men
appeared in the Center to escort him out of the building. I was shocked by the
speed with which this all happened. Even though I had complaints about his
behavior, I thought to escort him out as if he were some sort of criminal was
unnecessary. I actually felt sorry for him. Fortunately, the situation did not stay
in limbo very long. Terry announced that they had hired a fitness company to
take over the running of the Center. A substitute person began teaching some
of the classes, and by June 1, a permanent person, Alex, had been put in charge.
The woman who had been working in the Center along with the man who was
fired stayed until July 15, when she left for good.
    Once the change had been announced and new employees began to take
over the classes, I was surprised by how quickly we all adjusted to the new
situation. Alex and Shea, whom she hired to teach as well, have done a great
job taking over in a difficult situation, and as far as I can tell, all of us are more
than satisfied by their work.



L essons from R ol and Park P l ace
Fortunately for me, although the upheaval in the Fitness Center was difficult
for us all, at the same time a positive change had occurred in my professional
life. Mary Alice Wolf, who was in charge of the book reviews published in
Educational Gerontology, asked me to review a book titled Women in the Middle
by Elaine Brody, a well-known gerontological scholar. The book was first
published in 1990 and then revised and reissued in 2004. I found the inter-
views with caregivers to be fascinating. Because in my youth my parents did
84   Anne M. Wyatt-Brown


     not live with their aging relatives, I had no idea that so many people felt morally
     obliged to take their elders into their dwellings, nor did I know how miserable
     the situation sometimes made the caregivers and the parents as well.
         While writing the review, I discovered that in 2010, at the age of 88, Brody
     had published another article for The Gerontologist related to her research in the
     book (“On Being”). In it she talks about being in a condo for the elderly. Unlike
     my facility, it had no health care, but it offered her the company of many lively
     people. She found that most of them shared the same concerns. In her article
     she mentions how much she was learning from listening to the comments and
     asides of her new friends. In fact, she reports that “listening and translating
     what I hear” had become “organized listening (research)” (9). She recalls that
     years before, when she had talked to interviewers of older people, they advised
     her to pay attention to the subtext of what the people were saying, their “cries,
     whispers and silence” (9). When she moved into the condo, she acknowledged
     that she was “a very very old person” (9). For the first time she could make
     direct use of her own experience, in combination with the wealth of knowledge
     from her professional life. She learned that older people did not like it when
     their adult children tried to take over the decision making about their lives.
     Since I was in a situation similar to Brody’s, being a gerontologist who lived
     in a CCRC, I was enormously impressed by her work and felt that my efforts
     were supported by her decision to continue doing research while she was in the
     condo.
         As a result of reading some of Brody’s research, I began to understand
     that the upheavals at RPP could be of interest to other gerontologists. Most
     important, the loss of Valencio taught me that those who move into a CCRC
     which has managers, like Roland Park Place, to a certain extent have traded
     autonomy for the promise of long-term care. In many ways we are dependent
     on our institution’s employees, a situation that was unnerving when Valencio
     was forced out of RPP. We have learned that we might face unpleasant situ-
     ations in the future as well. On the other hand, those who run our place do
     not want unhappy residents who might discourage newcomers from moving
     in. As a result, they do take action when residents are unduly upset by what is
     happening.
         Therefore it is most important that would-be residents move in early
     enough to learn which employees are reliable. Some behave like Atul Gawande,
     the author of Being Mortal, who discovered that he could not help patients
     unless he asked what made surviving worthwhile. Fortunately, a good many
     employees want to be helpful and sometimes go out of their way to do so.
     Others are indifferent to our feelings, and a few rarely speak to residents.
     Despite that, in time those who are in charge of this place eventually discover
     that some employees behave in inappropriate ways and as a result decide to part
     company with them.
                                                            On Not Being Invisible   85


    I think we residents have to learn to be resilient and resourceful when things
seem to be going in the wrong direction. Patience is a very important virtue.
Recently, a new employee in the dining room ruffled quite a few feathers. A
friend wanted to organize an official letter of complaint signed by many people.
I thought that we should wait and see what transpired. As it happened, we
learned quite recently that the employee is no longer working here. Apparently,
enough individual complaints about his behavior had convinced the authorities
to accept his resignation.
    Moreover, we are facing a difficult time now that the building is being
“repositioned” in order to make RPP financially viable. Most of the rooms on
the first floor are being moved around, and some second floor rooms are being
changed as well. Once that part of the job is completed, a new section of apart-
ments and parking spaces will be added to the old building. Once again, we
residents think that some of the problems of the construction might have been
handled more expeditiously if residents had been consulted sooner. Fortunately,
however, we recently learned that the architects plan to expand the part of the
Fitness Center where our large classes meet. For the time being, the problem of
inadequate space has been well handled since the company took over. Alex and
Shea doubled the number of classes taught each day. As a result, rarely does a
resident find too little space in the classes. Most people are very pleased with
the new schedule, and the number of people attending classes has increased.
    Of course, having a building under construction is not much fun. On the
other hand, some of the changes will allow RPP to offer a more advanced kind
of memory care by reconfiguring the assisted-living apartments and health-
care rooms. Instead of long corridors, there will be some pods, small groups of
rooms around a common room that will permit the employees to work more
one-on-one with residents who have dementia.
    Like Gawande, I think one should try to find out what qualities of life really
matter to the individual. It makes sense to encourage aging people to explore
the possibilities of a variety of retirement options when they are young enough
to adjust to a different place and a new group of people. It matters what choices
we make while we still can do so.
    I don’t know if I had anticipated the kinds of friendships that I would make
at the time we moved in. But as time has passed, I realize that what makes
RPP work for me most of the time is the comfort of friendship and companion-
ship. I have had many interactions with residents and some employees that are
delightful. I discovered that in times of trouble we can count on people to be
supportive. Many residents have lost family members or had health issues that
frightened them, so they write notes or say kind things when one’s spouse dies
or we experience serious health problems. Unlike the outside world, which can
make older people feel invisible, as Roger Angell reported in a 2014 article in
86   Anne M. Wyatt-Brown


     The New Yorker, fellow residents do not dismiss us. They offer condolences and
     good wishes in times of trouble.
         A group of us eat many meals together in the café and enjoy meeting for
     Sunday brunch in the main dining room. As a result, we have gotten to know
     each other very well. Sometimes the conversations are extraordinary. Some
     Sundays ago, Sally, one of the regulars at brunch, started to mention The Night-
     ingale, a novel she was reading about Vichy France in World War II. From that
     beginning she told us about family members who found themselves trapped in
     the same place when the war broke out. Some managed to escape, but others
     did not. Although these tragedies happened many years ago, the feelings they
     evoked in her were fresh. At times she said that she couldn’t continue to tell
     us what had happened; it was too painful. I think we all realized that we were
     having a most moving and unusual conversation that could not have happened
     if our friendships had been superficial.
         In conclusion, gerontologists need to draw on their practical experience
     with aging relatives and friends who have discussed what it is like to live in
     the many different kinds of places that are currently available for older people.
     Like Golant, who visited the places he wrote about and interviewed residents,
     we need to combine our knowledge of the field with our personal observations.
     Without a combination of the academic and the personal, we will not be able to
     assist others who are facing the same choices that we confronted.

So many of their names begin with “M” and so many
are or sound the same – four Margery, three Margaret,
two Mary, a Martha, a Marilyn, a Marie. No wonder
they forget who they are, where they’ve come from,
what they’ve done and been. Words choke up on them,
they can’t hear each other speak. Stop whispering, they
hiss. Well, excuse me. One coughs into her napkin, one
wipes her weeping eye. Canes hooked on chair backs,
walkers parked by the wall.

A daughter joins her mother for lunch, is introduced
as the youngest, the oldest, the one in the middle. She
sits with her knees pressed tightly under the drape
of white vinyl, feet on the floor, elbows off the table.
They watch her chew and swallow, note how often
she empties her water glass. If she wears beads or pearls.
How many rings. Now she is introduced to Margery again.
Who asks who are you? Says beware of the fourth floor.
Who pleas it’s time to be going. Take me home.

Laura Dunbar


When I turned 35 years old and could no longer avoid the fact that, unless I did
something big in my life, not only were things not going to get better but could
and were already getting much worse, I enrolled as an adult learner in commu-
nity college. I didn’t have any idea what I wanted to take and I didn’t have a high
school diploma, so I hoped maybe, at best, to get accepted for a secretary course
or something. After I wrote a placement essay and did some other high-school
equivalency tests, though, a woman from the registrar’s office phoned me and
asked if I’d come in to talk with a student advisor. I went to see the advisor:
had I ever thought of becoming a nurse? With the help of a third woman, this
one a weary but patient financial aid officer, four months later I was in a basic
anatomy class for new nursing students.
    After the first semester, the regular registered nurse (RN) and the practical
nurse (RPN) streams split. I wanted to go on to become an RN and knew by
then that I had what it would take to do it, too, but my husband had one of his
reasonable dangerous afternoons during which he figured out several times
what the hourly wage for RPNs multiplied by forty hours would work out to
every week. His calculations confirmed that my new value to him wouldn’t be
significantly extended by the RN diploma. So he did in his straightforward way
what John Dos Passos, in the preface to Occasions and Protests, says all respon-
sible adults do, which is to decide which buds need to be pinched off – only Dos
Passos meant buds of one’s own making, of course, not of other people’s, which
is a considerably more permanent kind of cautery. But okay. With even a little
bit of school, I’d begun to feel like I could stand up straight in the world. I kept
that to myself, though.
    At graduation, I won an award. The ceremony was the first time my children
had seen me at a public event that had nothing to do with them. Within a week
I was hired at the hospital, on H2, a general medical-surgical floor. When I got
my first pay cheque, I realized I could shop at the Giant Tiger discount store
(“for you for less!”) because it was close, not because it was necessary. I brought
home five Sarah Lee frozen cakes that night and that’s what the kids and I had
for our celebration dinner. The evening news talked about working Canadians
94   Laura Dunbar


     and for the first time I was in that category – at the lowest end, to be sure, but
     I was there. If there’d been two of me, we would have almost made a regular
     middle-class household.
         Acute care was good work and if I didn’t feel it was my passion, as the
     Oprahists keep telling women their jobs ought to be, it certainly paid the bills
     and made me proud of myself. I was surprised and a bit ashamed, then, to find
     myself getting bored after only a little while. Hospitals nurture routine as a
     safety check against the malevolent willfulness of human bodies. If you’re used
     to doing the same things at the same time every shift – vitals, check; catheter
     output, check; dressing change, check – you should notice the unexpected.
     As a practical nurse, however, the restricted scope of practice that described
     my role didn’t allow me to do much more than report my observations to my
     RN partner. In Ontario, practical nurses were still not very far removed from
     the nurse’s aide model, and some of the older RNs didn’t think we could do
     anything but empty bedpans and make beds. So, while I could pick up as many
     shifts as I wanted in wards hit by C. difficile outbreaks, sweating under infec-
     tion control gowns and being up to my elbows in unimaginable quantities of
     bloody diarrhea didn’t feel at all like the application of the care planning model
     set out by the great American nursing theorist Sister Callista Roy, which I’d
     come across in the college library.
         There were other surprises, too. All the hospital television shows I’d ever
     seen made it seem like doctors and nurses were in conversation all the time,
     when in my experience the separations were distinct and non-negotiable.
     Doctors visited our floor like Joves muttering among their hinds, mostly obliv-
     ious to us except as extensions of their decisions. I found compensation for
     this class division in another thing the college teachers hadn’t told us: that
     being a nurse is being part of a female guildcraft circle. It was a female circle
     not just because it was composed mostly of women but also because it revolved
     on two axes: first, around the theoretical values most often attributed to good
     mothers – selflessness, patience, service; and second, around the lived experi-
     ences that are the outcome of a social belief in those mythic values – most of the
     circle’s members were overburdened with home responsibilities and under-rec-
     ognized both there and in their work lives. Most importantly for the lives inside
     the circle, the profession at that time was still shaped in essential ways by an
     unofficial mentoring model in which experience and intuition formed the
     foundation of the guild’s knowledge and guided its practices.
         Secure, close, not always friendly or even pleasant, it was a community with
     the tensile strength of wire. To the public, it shows only its Nightingale side –
     nurses are deeply invested in preserving their public historical image – but on
     the other side of the desk the masks come off. Few people, after all, are capable
     of professionalism for twelve hours straight.
                                                                    Shelter in Place    95


    Long shifts fasten people together. Out of those hours I gained new friends,
people to go to the Wing Qing Tuesday buffet with, baby showers to shop for,
holiday plans and Sandals cruise deals to hear about, people to dislike and roll
my eyes over, divorce collection envelopes to donate money to. I could give my
kids book-order money for school and buy them cheaply made but expensive
sneakers; I found my fragile youngest child in my uniform top pretending to
write in a chart about her hamster. I was a nurse, and that’s always a collective
noun. I was in my late thirties, and a new life was suddenly breaking over me in
twelve-hour shifts. Many people talk about the institution as a site of deperson-
alization, but for me nursing became my portal of entry to autonomy.
    For me, then, my membership in a (semi-)free association was the gateway
to my individuality. But there’s always a rule, and the rule was this: in the circle,
you hold your end. When someone spends her days off at the casino and her
breaks scratching tickets, you hold it. When someone loses it with a yappy
teenage daughter and goes from screaming to slapping to a fractured ulna and
a story to the ED doctor about a backyard trampoline, you hold it. When the
med record shows for the third time on a week’s shift run two Ativan refusals
(“wastage, patient refused” in neat tiny handwriting) you hold it. You hold it
and you hold on; you don’t go to those panoptical egrets in Human Resources.
Because the circle’s only as good as you are, and before long you’ll see that it’s
working for you, too. When my husband, indefatigably circular in his logic as
only the very stoned can be, called the desk every hour on pay day, it locked in
place around me, immoveable, impassive, impenetrable.
    The circle was red-tent succor and it raised in me a belief in the power of
groups of women who understood themselves to be basically alike because they
worked together and took from that work to the rest of their lives sources of
individual identity and group strength. Years later I would learn a word, “reifi-
cation,” that would make me question the ways and means of those identifica-
tions and the tenuous foundations upon which that strength rested. But while
the circle was around me I felt only its security.
    I didn’t know then that the circle was already dissolving under the pressure
of a health-care system driven into the ground by financial problems and by
attempts at solutions that would get rid of the informal guild tradition forever.
In its place was emerging a version of nursing professionalization that was the
function of a strangling desire for measurable outcomes and which, though it
advocates patient-centredness, actually alienated nurses from the people who
depended most on them.
    That discovery was some time away for me. At that moment, I was on the
bottom of the seniority list, and I was frustrated by my restricted scope of
practice. Luckily, the demographics of our town were in my favour. Most of
H2’s patients were elderly; many of them wound up there, whether they knew it
or not, as the first stop on a path that would see them placed in long-term care.

     I watched how this worked for a few months; I had liked my student clinical
     rotation in the local nursing homes. I sent off another set of applications, and
     in under a week I was hired again.
         My new job was at a just-opened long-term care facility located in the heart
     of a rural village north of our city. The region’s lakes and woods made it popular
     with summer cottagers, but many of the locals were struggling after down-
     sizing at several factories had left their major wage-earners with fewer hours or
     out of work altogether. Given the setting and the times, the addition of a state-
     of-the art care facility had made local headlines, and the building’s construc-
     tion had attracted many sightseers. In fact, in both theory and practice, the
     home was innovative, reflecting some of the newest theories in contemporary
     geriatric care.
         Next to the reception area, a shared outdoor courtyard formed the hub
     of the building. From it radiated, in geometric petals, four home units of 25
     rooms each. All four of these wings eventually looped back to the hub; the
     idea was that wandering residents could walk freely around the whole building
     without getting lost. Each unit was named after local parks or waterways and
     had its own nursing station as well as its own dining room, medication cart,
     and supply room. In the hub, there was also a hair salon, a private party room,
     an open-access kitchenette outfitted with a toaster, kettle, and a fridge so that
     residents could fix their own snacks or hot drinks, an activities room with a
     television and a kitchen equipped for more serious cooking activities, and an
     enclosed smoking room with heavy flame-proof aprons hanging from hooks.
     Sliding patio doors lined all sides of the central courtyard and the smaller
     gardens in the centre of some of the individual units’ wings; although they
     didn’t open more than a crack for safety reasons, in the summer the doors let
     in fresh breezes and they made the halls and dining rooms bright even in the
     winter. Courtesy of the local animal shelter, for a few months there was even
     an amiable obese cat.
         Because it was provincially funded, the facility fell under the purview of the
     Ministry of Long-Term Care, so one of its essential obligations was to meet the
     Ministry’s standards. Central to this mandate, the Resident Bill of Rights hung
     in the reception hall near the Director of Care’s office and set out what residents
     and their families could expect, in terms of both the standard of care and the
     delivery of that care. Also because of its provincial designation, the facility was
     committed to accepting residents whose care needs were substantial.
         I liked it from the start. Once my probationary period was over, I became the
     regular relief for a full-time RPN, so there was a sense of stability and security
     to my schedule. I enjoyed working with the same team of Personal Support
     Workers (PSWs) and getting to know the residents and their families. Each RPN
     was assigned two wings, or fifty rooms, and worked with two pairs of PSWs,
     one pair per wing. The med cart was my primary job responsibility, but when I
                                                                   Shelter in Place   97


was done giving medications to fifty people two or three times in eight hours,
I could do wound-care assessments and treatments, update care plans, process
orders or review the narrative notes in charts and leave requests for the doctor.
Our house doctor was a grave, conscientious man who talked to the staff seri-
ously about what we thought should be done. The complex needs of our patients
demanded my attention not just to their physical conditions but also to their
psychological, social, and spiritual needs. I found the mental exercise and the
intellectual discipline enormously satisfying. I became more secretive at home.
    The burden of physical labor – and it was a heavy one – fell on the PSWs,
most of whom were middle-aged women from the village and the nearby coun-
tryside. I made a point of helping when I could, and I was proud of the good
relationships I thought I had with them, but there is no escaping the fact that
the work they did was exhausting labor much harder than mine. The tasks
they were expected to perform in pairs in a single shift would have challenged
twice as many workers half their age. For example, two day-shift PSWs were
expected to have 25 people washed, dressed, and in the dining room by 8:00
every morning, when their shifts began at only 7:00 and when at least twelve
of those people could, to varying degrees, be what we called in the care plans
“resistant to care,” a euphemism that could mean anything from dead-weight
stiffening to pinching, spitting, slapping, or kicking. If a resident didn’t attend
a meal, it was my duty to find out about it and write the reasons the PSWs gave
in the chart and tape them for the RN report. Another major discouragement
to leaving recalcitrant residents in their rooms for a meal was the requirement
that at least one PSW then feed the person in the room, which left her partner
alone in a dining room to serve and help clear every course as well as to feed
perhaps five or six people at risk from various problems related to dysphagia.
    Not surprisingly, I saw that the PSWs often felt about us, the RPNs, the
same way we felt about the RNs in the hospital. I tried to let them know I
appreciated the work they did, but I knew they were skeptical. I didn’t blame
them for suspecting insincerity. We worked together and relied on each other
too much for me not to know how unfair it was and how often they got hurt on
a shift. Unlike the hospital, all the staff in the home got to know each other,
and well. In the hospital, we almost never talked to the housekeepers or lab
technicians who worked on the floors with us, let alone the kitchen staff who
would every day bring and remove the meal trays. But in the home, you took
your breaks with everyone else. Not infrequently, many of the staff who worked
there were friends or even relatives outside of work, too. So the circle in the
home took on a different quality, one that was more intimate in some ways but
also more diffuse and unpredictable because it included people from different
work categories. There were also those definite and widespread ties to the local
community outside the home, which didn’t apply at the hospital. My husband
had grown up in the village and was well known to many of the staff members’
98   Laura Dunbar


     husbands and therefore to the staff members as well. As Alice Munro knew,
     when I was offered rural Ontario kindness I was also obligated, on occasion, to
     welcome reminders of my shame.
          On days when I wanted to avoid the staff breakroom, I would eat my lunch
     in the medication supply room and then wander the halls looking at the display
     boxes mounted outside each of the residents’ rooms. It was a way for me to get
     to know who these people were and what they had been like in their “before”
     lives. When I was behind the med cart, I had so little time to do anything
     but make sure I was getting the right med into the right person that it made
     me ashamed of my rudeness. The residents who’d been there for some time
     knew that I didn’t have time to talk beyond the briefest courtesies, and so they
     wouldn’t bother many times to do anything but open their mouths automati-
     cally. For this and other reasons they reminded me, fancifully, of birds, bright-
     eyed but mostly silent during my med passes. In my imagination, I began to
     see them as different species: Jean was a crow, watchful and ingenious; Beth
     was a chickadee, cheerful and busy; Jim was a jay, ready to pinch or squawk.
     Suzanne and her cousin Mrs. Norbert were sensible agreeable hens, always
     together, fussing over each other’s families and busy about the hallways, their
     walker baskets filled with snacks and Kleenex and festooned with the grand-
     kids’ beaded lanyards. Callie was an ostrich: large, fast, and dangerously able to
     grab ponytails and yank hair out or kick hard on her way by. Ted was a dispar-
     aging aloof swan.
          As the months passed, of course, I got to know people outside of the medi-
     cation cart routine, and with some I formed connections that were a great deal
     deeper. It is not an exaggeration to say that I loved many of them then as much
     as I love my children or my current husband. I carry them with me, even though
     it’s been years since I let my registration lapse.
          Jenny’s husband died at 45, leaving her with a 50-acre dairy operation and
     three boys. Work and prudence had been her life’s watchwords. As the scourge
     of her dementia burned away at her, she would name us by what she knew: I
     was Pill or Walk; the PSWs could be Bath or Sleep, Snack or Kiss. Sometimes
     we were Bad or Cow. As can be the case, her dementia touched many things but
     left other elements of her personality intact. Before the dayshift arrived, she’d
     already be washing down the counter in the kitchenette with a dry rag. By the
     time I went looking for her after morning report, she’d have finished that job
     and moved on to wheeling herself into other residents’ rooms, exhorting them
     in her way to get up and get ready for school: “Bus!” When she saw me, though,
     she’d leave that to wheel herself along behind me as I pushed my med cart – did
     it remind her of a tractor or a wheelbarrow? She’d wait patiently outside each
     room while I checked and poured or counted and recorded. When I turned the
     cart’s lock and made to push again, she’d nod calmly at me as if to say: “Yes, that
     one’s done right, now on to the next.” At the end of the pass, I held the med-re-
                                                                  Shelter in Place   99


cord book for her to look at, and would be rewarded by another nod: “Yes, all
good here; let’s go.”
     Like me, on a bad day she could be comforted by kittens – though the actual
cat had been rehomed after an unfortunate hilarious incident involving its litter
box, we kept a supply of fakes and Jenny and I enjoyed them together. Jenny
loved pictures of kittens, her stuffed kitty, and talk about kittens. It made me
happy to think of this tough woman running her farm by herself, raising three
strapping rowdy boys, taking no nonsense from anyone, and stopping to pick up
and cuddle each of the barn kittens as her dignified middle son, now in charge
of the farm, told me she’d done every working morning of her “before” life.
     Sometimes, when I was done looking at my lunchtime display boxes and
still had interminable break minutes left, I would find Jenny. She’d pat my arm,
gentle as a mother, and for a second I thought I could feel both our minds
uncloud. Her sharp eyes looked right into mine. I knew she was suddenly fully
present and not just present but present with me. For a split second, she knew
all about it, all about me, and she was sympathetic. Maybe it was projection on
my part. I can imagine an argument that would charge that I’d let my own need
impose itself on another helpless human being, and that doing so diminished
her right to be herself. I don’t know. To me it felt like Jenny and I were there
together, even just for a second.
     Norma, on the other hand, had once owned a movie theatre with her
husband and had been a ballroom dance teacher. Whereas Jenny’s display case
was stuffed full of family bric-a-brac, and her daughters-in-law regularly edited
and re-stuffed it for her, Norma’s display box held nothing but a single old photo
of her in a tweed pencil skirt, two fat dachshunds in her lap, hair pulled back,
modish black-framed glasses framed by dramatically plucked brows. Even in
black and white, you could see she’d been wearing plum lipstick. Norma had
had a stroke and was silent and contractured, her hands curled into sparrow’s
claws. Her supply of clothes was basic and ugly: she had no daughters-in-law
to fuss and choose. Every time I looked at her, I saw the vivid plum-coloured
woman in the photograph, laughing back at the photographer. I still don’t know
why, but I found her, like Jenny, inexplicably restful to be around. When I had
desk work to do, it became my habit to bring Norma with me and park her chair
beside mine. Once every month or so, her husband would come and find her
sitting with me and he’d take her back to her room to visit. Norma was slight
and could still bear her weight with help, so it was easy for him to put her back
to bed by himself when he was done visiting. When we saw him leave we’d go
in and wash her. Pull her pants back up.
     Sometimes I thought she was looking at me, and other times the PSWs
would say she’d whispered something to them, but we could never tell for sure.
As her conditioned worsened and it became clear that she was actively dying, I
wanted to be with her as much as I could. On evening shifts when the last med
100   Laura Dunbar


      pass was finished, I would go to her room and check on her; if I felt she was
      awake I’d talk to her. I needed someone to talk to. I’d registered for classes at the
      university and was being upset every week by new ideas. It seemed like Norma
      would understand how life can crouch at you one minute and in the next unveil
      possibilities you’d never imagined. I felt both more helpless and more powerful
      with every passing month, caught in the synapse between an unspooling past
      and a violently gathering future. The storms were rolling across my mind. The
      plum woman in the photograph raised her eyebrows at me and laughed.
          I was taking a poetry survey course and had begun to whisper some of the
      verses to myself while I was caught up in the rhythm of my med-cart work. I
      liked knowing the lines, turning them over and over till they were smooth –
      for every poem I memorized I promised myself I could get rid of for good one
      of the stones I habitually carried in my pockets. One stone at a time, I was
      growing lighter.
          One evening near the end, I was with Norma and trying to remember the
      last line of a poem the professor had read to us that week. I struggled out loud,
      went back to the beginning: “A loaf of bread, a jug of wine / A loaf of bread, a jug
      of wine” – loaves and jugs. Nothing. It was time to go and tape the last report for
      the night shift. A new charge nurse, who had worked on quality assurance with
      the Ministry and who had never heard of circles she didn’t want to smash, had
      a rule in which unscheduled time with residents in their rooms could get staff
      written up. I said goodnight to Norma and turned out her light.
          In the darkness I heard it. I heard her.

      And thou, singing beside me in the wilderness.

      For a long time after I quit, I’d have this dream. I was hurrying through the
      home’s halls looking for something, I don’t know what, while a clever alert
      thing loped up on me, got closer behind me, was slipping along the wall only
      one corner away now. In the next instant I’d find myself back at the hub. The
      door to the garden was wide open: a million bright birds were floating, hanging
      in the trembling singing air. It was open for me, too. I could go in to that circle.
      All was well. I went through. Between Jenny and Norma, I’d sit and we’d listen.
          Norma, I hear you.

      Author’s note: Some readers may wonder about the ending of this work of creative
      non-fiction. While it is true that I left this job shortly after the events described at the
      end, I left only because I was offered a position with more hours in another long-term
      care facility. Like many nurses, my dependence on the profession outweighed my unhap-
      piness about specific circumstances. Even though more than ten years has passed
      since I gave up my registration, those tensions remain, though mitigated somewhat by
      the passage of time and by the significance I now know nursing had in my life.

Just What Is Real Anyway?

Peter J. Whitehouse


Aging represents both a demographic challenge and an opportunity to reinvent
the story of humanity in a new way. As a geriatric neurologist involved in the
clinical care of persons with dementia and in prevention and public health, a
cognitive neuroscientist studying both dementia and wisdom, and an ecologi-
cally oriented bioethicist concerned about a sustainable future for our species
and others, I see aging and care as important issues in themselves. However,
they also have a role to play in leveraging culture change, not only in long-
term care but also in society at large. Much-needed genuine hope for the future
can come in many forms, but we must be vigilant about detecting unreal
false hope (like biomedical models of curing age-related conditions such as
dementia), instead building up real true hope, for example by adjusting our
expectations about inevitable material and scientific progress based on unlim-
ited resources.
     We need to think long term and with care about caring, across the life course,
through time, and around the globe. Hence, the focus of this Care Home Stories
book has significant implications for the broader challenges that humanity
faces in today’s world. Examining the challenges, changes, and continuities
of care home stories in the narrowest context of people’s experiences in places
identified as providing enduring care, like nursing homes and assisted living,
is an important enterprise in its own right. However, as in every field of human
endeavor, it is critical to examine the widest context for the evolving changes in
any narrow domain of human activity by examining the patterns in culture and
nature in which those changes are embedded. With the current intense global
connectedness of the world of ideas and the world of nations and communities,
it is all the more critical to look at problems and potential solutions from a big
picture perspective, that is to say as systems thinkers and not as narrow special-
ists. This broader shift characterizes the evolution of my own thinking from
being a neuroscientist studying brain nuclei and pharmaceutical interventions
to being a change agent in relation to the flourishing of human and other life.
104   Peter J. Whitehouse


      Our future survival depends on our ability to see intergenerative connections
      between modes of thought and action, between professions and disciplines,
      and between communities of diverse composition. Intergenerative is a word we
      coined (see below) to signify going between sources of cultural generativity
      (like intergenerational and interdisciplinary or even transdisciplinary) to create
      innovations in thinking and valuing. We are in a world where we must reflect
      deeply on our experiences and imagine more connected and healthier soci-
      eties. Trusting and sustainable relationships are key to the intellectual and
      value explorations and reflections. This reimagining of aging and care is the
      subject of this chapter that describes relationships with two personal mentors
      and three related experiences in long-term care.



      M y L ong -Term M entors : S id K at z and J oe F ole y
      My long-term care home experiences began with two mentors, Drs. Sid Katz
      and Joe Foley. The lessons I learned from these two wise elders colored not only
      my professional career engaging with nursing homes and assisted living but
      also my sense of who I am as a human being, especially now as an emerging
      elder. Relationships, particularly those between people of different generations
      and different life experiences, are key to human flourishing as individuals and
      as communities – a theme to which I will return later.
          Sid Katz was a distinguished geriatrician – a member of the National
      Academy of Medicine. He developed the Katz ADL scale, which is still a
      widely used instrument to assess the functional capabilities of older people
      in the community and in long-term care. He was the first author of the Insti-
      tute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) report that trans-
      formed the way we think about assessing and changing nursing homes. The
      report, entitled “Improving the Quality of Care in Nursing Homes,” led to
      fundamental changes in the structure, process, and outcomes of care and
      reimbursement of nursing homes. It also motivated the development of the
      Uniform Minimum Data Set (UMDS), which nursing homes were required
      to collect in order to measure quality of care. I actually worked on the Cogni-
      tive RAP (Resident Assessment Protocol) that is part of the UMDS. Dementia
      is a common condition in long-term care, and my practice caring for people
      with cognitive impairment motivated in part my interest in long-term care and
      working with Sid.
          Sid chose his words carefully, because clarity of communication was critical
      to how he shared his theoretical ideas. He was Jewish, a fact that emphasized
      his rabbinical nature: he was a true teacher, one who sought out young people
      to mentor. We wrote a paper together (Whitehouse et al.) on the relationship
      between wisdom and quality of life, a concept that continued to be a dominant
                                                    Long-Term Care for the Future   105


theme in my own scholarship and engagement in life. One key lesson I learned
from Sid was when he told me how he imagined the changes that might occur
in nursing homes based on his work, but that they would not occur until long
after his own death. This sense of long-term thinking past one’s own personal
mortality stuck with me. It also influenced my thinking that you are not
socially dead even after you have ceased to breathe, in the sense that your story
goes on beyond personal mortality. The idea of legacy became key as I thought
about my own career and the lives of my older patients. Legacy was a name
and a concept that I used in many of my later long-term care intergenerational
projects, as described below.
    Joe Foley was almost the polar opposite: a neurologist with an Irish sense
of humor and concern for the particular. He was actively Catholic but cultur-
ally irreverent. He was a storyteller and would share his past adventures in
Boston Catholic schools and in his neurology residency with some of the early
neurological greats at Harvard. He was a model for committed patient care
and for not putting up with nonsense. He once told me that I should say little
about nursing homes until I had actually lived in one. He thought that the
UMDS caused too much paperwork and took nursing assistants and nurses
away from patient care. Joe’s stories were all about the past – his past mentors
and students. So if Sid oriented me to the future, Joe taught me the value of
understanding your roots. To exaggerate a bit, Sid was a man of future ideas,
Joe of past stories.
    Both of them transformed my thinking. My early career had been successful
as a neuroscientist describing brain changes in patients with Alzheimer’s. I
was a leader in developing drugs to treat people with dementia. However, both
Sid and Joe allowed me to see the bigger picture. As the power of pharma-
ceutical and genetics models and economics corrupted the biomedical field,
I became concerned that false hope based on promises of pharmaceutical
fixes were seducing us. One phrase I came to dislike was “care today; cure
tomorrow”: it implied that we just needed to invest enough biological research
dollars to eradicate the problem of Alzheimer’s, and hence care would become
outdated. By that time, it was clear that our understanding of dementia was
confused and that Alzheimer’s was composed of a diverse set of processes inti-
mately related to aging that drugs would not effectively address. Hence, care
today and care tomorrow are critically important. Besides, I came to realize that
if we improved the care of people with dementia, we would improve the quality
of life for all of us. Caring for persons with dementia opens opportunities for
individual and community growth.
106   Peter J. Whitehouse


      F irst L esson : the F lood
      My first story in long-term care begins when I finally took Joe’s long-offered
      advice and lived in assisted living in Toronto between 2011 and 2013. As part
      of my fieldwork as a strategic advisor in innovation to the CEO of one of the
      University of Toronto’s hospitals, I was a part-time resident in The Terraces,
      an independent/assisted-living facility that is part of Baycrest Health Sciences.
      The Terraces was a lesson in the reality of the future of long-term care in many
      ways, but one stands out for me. During my stay, a powerful storm flooded the
      transformer in the basement, forcing the evacuation of the residents to various
      locations depending on their level of frailty. I was prepared because I had just
      returned from a camping vacation, so I had my headlamp to walk the darkened
      halls and appropriate clothing and food to weather the storm. The inability to
      repair the transformer and restore power quickly necessitated an evacuation in
      which I provided some assistance. Some whose families could accommodate
      them went home, some who were too sick went to the hospital, and the majority
      went to the nearby Holiday Inn, a place that I was quite familiar with based on
      previous visits.
          In our Baycrest case, the event ended up being a community-building
      success as a result of great staff and organizational response, but that is not
      likely always to be the outcome. These kinds of severe weather events will
      increase in the future because of climate change. How can we learn from disas-
      ters in order to be better prepared the next time? In both Hurricane Katrina
      and superstorm Sandy, many of the most vulnerable were elders. Decisions
      about whether to evacuate nursing homes or to allow residents to ride out the
      storm in place were difficult. Mass evacuations are stressful and expensive.
      Understandably, circumstances became overwhelming, and in some instances
      elders clearly died in long-term care (with perhaps some being helped to die
      through physician-assisted euthanasia).



      S econd L esson : the U nre alit y S hows
      During my career, I visited many long-term care units around the world, espe-
      cially in Japan and Europe. I was involved in studying SCUs (Special Care
      Units) for people with dementia. Many tried to help people with dementia feel
      at home by allowing them to bring personal furniture and mementos when
      they moved in. One locale took this attitude to such an extreme that I felt a
      bit uncomfortable – an unreal reality. That place, Hogeweyk, a nursing home
      in the Netherlands, achieved international media attention by being called
      Dementiaville. It started a movement called Dementia Villages.
                                                    Long-Term Care for the Future    107


     Rather ironically, I visited Hogeweyk with Vicki de Klerk, a leader of the
international Validation Therapy movement. Validation asks us to try to see the
world through the eyes – that is, the past life and current experiences, of the
elder with dementia. The facility creates an environment that is designed to
mask the dementia by pretending that the residents are in an earlier time and
place, complete with a non-functional bus stop perhaps to fool the residents
into thinking they are free to leave. Units were designed to match various forms
of Dutch social life (one even mimicked Indonesia for those who immigrated to
the Netherlands from the former colony). The community is invited in to shop,
go to the theater, and eat at their restaurant.
     The project has been compared to the 1998 movie The Truman Show, a
satirical comedy featuring Jim Carrey playing an adult who had been raised
since birth by a corporation and who lived in a simulated television game-
show village. This was an early form of reality television. During our visit to
Hogeweyk, both Vicki and I were slightly put off, not so much by the several
hundred Euro fee for a short interview, but by our guide’s apparent lack of
interest in our work or our views. Staff seemed to be in a world of their own
making and focused on their business model.
     The Glenner Centers in San Diego is developing a superficially similar but
essentially different project called Town Square. Their planned reconstruction
of a San Diego urban environment within a large warehouse involves a place
to visit, not live. The sets include a grocery store, a drugstore, clothing shops,
an auto shop, museums, schools, and other places one might find in a town
square. The project involves creating activities for persons with dementia as
well as their caregivers and other family members (and perhaps others). Unlike
Hogeweyk, this program seems more playful, where being back in time is
a form of storytelling and play rather than fostering an actual false belief of
being in an earlier historical period. The opportunity to be intergenerational
exists. Play amongst children and elders is something that comes naturally and
should be encouraged. Such an environment can foster relationship building
and mutual learning.
     Town Square links to broader efforts to make communities more demen-
tia-friendly around the world. Most of these efforts focus on helping people
with dementia navigate their own “real” community and assist community
members to better understand the effects of cognitive loss on their fellow
citizens. This process of adapting communities seems more real to me than
pretending an entire residential ward exists in the 1950s. The learning that can
come from visits to such a living museum can foster flexible thinking; playful
reminiscence seems better than serious fakery.

      Third L esson : I ntergener ativit y
      Whatever you think of reality, today it seems at times to be quite unreal. The
      United States and other political environments seem full of Orwellian 1984
      language games to the point that we now have alternative facts and fake news.
      The world is changing rapidly and is full of wicked problems, amazing oppor-
      tunities, and complex challenges that seem difficult to fathom and act upon.
      Climate change and income inequity would rise to the top for me as problems.
      We seem to be missing the courage and wisdom to address our current ecolog-
      ical, economic, and social realities. We are becoming more of a danger to our
      own species and others as we enter the Anthropocene – a geologic age domi-
      nated by human activity. Yet maybe we can find the wisdom to foster values
      and take actions to address these challenges. Never has a hopeful vision for the
      future been more important to the human species. Reimagining both “aging”
      and “care” can be a part of this process, with enormous short- and long-term
      implications for our species. My experiences in long-term care have contrib-
      uted to my shift in focus from medical to social interventions.
          My last and latest experience with a long-term care institution offers a
      positive vision of the future. It is intergenerational in nature, creating opportu-
      nities for children, youth, adults, and elders to interact. It involved two innova-
      tive partners, a long-term care facility and a public community school. Judson
      Smart Living is a long-term care complex closest to the original intergenera-
      tional school founded by my wife, others, and me in 2000. My wife, a develop-
      mental psychologist, wanted to start a school to serve the needs of disadvantaged
      children who were not getting a good education in the Cleveland Metropolitan
      School District. As a geriatric neurologist I felt we needed to create spaces in
      society for elders in general, and especially those with dementia, to continue to
      contribute to community.
          We both believed that learning was most powerful with a focus on
      holistic experiences and social construction. We believed that relationships
      and reading were critical to empowering students to get a good start in life,
      particularly those born in disadvantaged social and economic situations. We
      now have three intergenerational schools that have been nationally and inter-
      nationally recognized for their contributions to the education of children and
      the brain health of elders. For example, in 2012 we were awarded the Eisner
      Prize for lifetime achievement in intergenerational advocacy. The pedagogy of
      our schools involves creating opportunities for children of elementary-school
      age and adults and elders to form mostly one-on-one relationships and share
      stories. Reading mentoring involves pairs of different ages that read books to
      each other or share stories from their lives.
          The “Legacy of the Clark Freeway Fighters” was one such co-constructed
      narrative project. The children in our school interviewed elders who in the
                                                    Long-Term Care for the Future    109


1960s had saved the local nature center in Shaker Heights, which our children
often visit, from a corrupt politician who wished to place a highway through it.
We published a book of stories and photographs capturing the spirit of their
activism in hopes of perpetuating such spirited citizenship in the minds and
hearts of our children (Harris and Whitehouse). We published the story as an
article in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society entitled “Occupy Nature:
Passing Activism across Generations” (George et al.). We also won an award
from the Environmental Protection Agency for capturing the pedagogical expe-
riences that we shared with elders in the nature center.
     Some of the elders who came to the nature center with us were from the
community, but most were from Judson Smart Living. The school bus and the
senior transport bus would arrive at the same time, and the naturalist teachers
prepared lessons about the importance of understanding our watersheds and
other environmental features and community. Essentially the seniors served as
mentors for the children, as in our signature reading mentoring program, for
example. However, as I learned from Joe and Sid, mentoring can be reciprocal,
as youngsters taught elders about computers, for example.
     Upon the fifteenth anniversary of our first intergenerational school, we
created “The Intergenerativity Project.” With Richard Geer and Qinghong Wei
from Community Performance International, we collected stories from many
people in the school, including students, staff, teachers, parents, volunteers,
and board members. The stories captured the spirit of the school and formed
the foundation of a community play called Moments and Memories that was
performed both at Judson Smart Living and in the school. The title of the project
comes from a word we invented to capture the importance of relationships in
innovation. Generativity is a word associated with opportunities created by
aging and other human activities to bring forth experiences, stories, and poten-
tial wisdom gained by an individual. Intergenerativity means bringing sources
of creativity together to create something new. We say it is innovation through
integration, or “going between to go beyond” (Katz and Whitehouse).
     This collaboration between an innovative school and a long-term care
partner led to knowledge and wisdom as well as love and compassion. The
important message of the story is that long-term care facilities are a part of
community, just as schools are. Children and elders are the most vulnerable in
our society, yet they represent our past and our future. So too can the power of
intergenerational learning and stories enrich our understanding of the possible.
Those who control the present – adults – would do well to listen to the full
range of human experience and imagination in our efforts to avoid the failure
of repeating unsuccessful attempts at addressing contemporary challenges. If
we are to create resilient communities that can survive and thrive in response
to the social, economic, and ecological challenges we face, it is important that
caring for the long term emerge as a fundamental attribute not only of health
110   Peter J. Whitehouse


      institutions and educational programs but also of the entire community. Just as
      I remember Sid and Joe as mentors, I remember that collective wisdom begins
      in individual relationships and shared stories.

Dementia (Re)performed
Interrogating Tensions between Relational Engagement
and Regulatory Policies in Care Homes through Theatre

Julia Gray, Pia Kontos, Sherry Dupuis, Gail Mitchell,
and Christine Jonas-Simpson



As an interdisciplinary group of health and artist researchers, we are concerned
about the ways in which many persons living with dementia in long-term care
homes are invalidated and treated as dysfunctional, thereby promoting social
exclusion, depriving them of their dignity, and threatening their quality of life.
We are concerned about the ways in which persons with dementia are framed
as lost, robbed of mind, doomed, gutted, and the living dead. As part of this, we
are conscious of the ways the “tragedy discourse” (Mitchell et al., “Dementia”)
is culturally produced through media and artistic representations and the
ways it is manifested in care practices and policies in institutional settings,
conceptualized as a kind of “social action.”1 This tragedy discourse is found in
mass media, academic, and policy documents and in the reductive and dehu-
manizing nature of dementia care that is characterized by the management
of “challenging behaviours” with mechanical and/or pharmacological restraint
(Maust et al.; Dupuis et al., “Pathologizing”).
     Theatre and cultural theorist Anne Davis Basting discusses North American
society’s understanding and representation of dementia through two dominant
narratives. First, earnest scientists attempt to combat an adversarial dementia,
if they could only be given enough time and money to fight for and find a cure.
As an example, Basting draws on the 2004 documentary film The Forgetting.
Here Alzheimer’s Disease, as the most common form of dementia, is a “slow
and silent killer” that “draws the curtain over the patient’s life and pulls family

1 | As critical researchers, we understand that this term generally has more positive,
disruptive associations. For the purposes of this chapter, we conceptualize “social
action” broadly, as “a thing done or created” following particular, normative social
assumptions, in this case care practices and policies in institutional settings.
112   Julia Gray, Pia Kontos, Sherr y Dupuis, Gail Mitchell, and Christine Jonas-Simpson


      into its devastating grasp.” The narrative of the film follows the scientific race
      to discover the cause of the disease and how to cure it, citing broken families
      drowning in its wake as the reason for the quest (Basting 35–36).
          The second dominant storyline that Basting discusses is the loss of an excep-
      tional, accomplished (and probably inspiring) person who is slowly emptied out
      by the destructive disease. She cites the example of the media’s coverage of
      President Ronald Reagan’s diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease, which conveyed
      a tragic fall of Shakespearean magnitude. And while perhaps this coverage
      brought awareness to Alzheimer’s beyond any public service announcement,
      magazine article or book, it also impressed the high stakes “then/now” tragic
      storyline deep into the North American cultural landscape.
          These conceptions of dementia as produced and perpetuated through media
      and artistic representations have profound implications for policy development
      in long-term care homes. In Canada, long-term care homes are governed by
      provincial legislation, which attempts to standardize care and accountability
      and requires homes, their management, and staff members to operationalize
      codes of conduct through institution-specific policies and practices. In the
      province of Ontario, long-term care homes are expected to satisfy as many as
      400 rules (Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care). For example, it is quite
      alarming to us that the Long-Term Care Act of Ontario has several hundred
      pages of standards and expectations relating to numerous aspects of care,
      except for a standard about meaningful relationships and supporting living. A
      similar critique has been articulated by Julia Twigg in the context of the United
      Kingdom; she argues that care time is defined in terms of easily measured tasks,
      where written standards pertain to the execution of tasks and the allotted time
      spent on any given task (Twigg, “Deconstructing”; “Carework”). Timeframes
      for bathing, eating, and restraining are marked out in detail, but not those for
      loving, relating, and thriving. As Kontos and Naglie state, citing Crawshaw:
      “The rationale of economic efficiency creates a system wherein the measure
      of care lies with the physical task rather than the quality of human interaction
      and, as a consequence, the relationship between the care provider and recipient
      is not quintessentially one of caring” (550; see also Thompson, “Towards”).
          Furthermore, there is a statement in the Ontario Act which implies that
      restraint and force are acceptable if used to complete bodily, physical care. This
      physical care is understood to override all other kinds of care at the risk of both
      the resident’s emotional well-being and the relationship between resident and
      health-care worker. Additionally, the growing risk-aversion culture of long-term
      care has led to the production of organizational policies that result in the social
      exclusion and isolation of older adults living in long-term care homes from
      broader communities. As an example, research shows that some long-term care
      homes in Ontario have stopped all outings outside the home setting, citing that

the risks of a resident becoming injured or lost are too high for the homes to
take (Wiersma & Dupuis; Dupuis et al., “Creating”).
     In order to disrupt the tragedy discourse that underlies both cultural
production (such as media and artistic representations) and social actions
(such as policy development), we embarked upon the creation of a research-in-
formed play, Cracked: New Light on Dementia. Cracked was developed to open up
a playful, social space to raise questions about current conceptions of dementia,
expose unjust care practices and policies, and facilitate the envisioning and
inspiring of an alternative care culture in which compassionate relationships
and supporting living are at the core. We aimed to use an art form – theatre –
to engage both each other and audiences intellectually and emotionally, by
exploring stories, emotional and sensory experiences, theoretical concepts, and
research findings within space and time (see Thompson, Performance; Boal;
Rossiter et al.; Mitchell et al., “Research-Based”; Jackson; Mitchell et al., “Expe-
rience”; Kontos and Poland).
     The theatrical form, when engaged for social and personal change, holds
the potential to provide an aesthetic space for audience members not only to
engage critically or analyze concepts and ideas intellectually but also to engage
aesthetically, including emotionally, sensorily, and imaginatively. Through
theatre, audience members can be provided the opportunity to reflect on how
their thoughts, feelings, and senses extend to actions, including representa-
tion and policy (Gray). Critics discuss how linear, discrete educational and
knowledge translation initiatives tend to overlook complex interrelationships
among taken-for-granted assumptions, including what is felt and sensed, and
social and personal actions (Kontos and Poland; Shor). We were therefore
looking for a way for all involved to vulnerably and safely explore dominant
tragic assumptions, including how individual actions (such as how one might
engage a person with dementia in conversation) and social actions (such as
policy) might reproduce those assumptions. We were additionally looking for a
way to imagine possibilities for alternative ways of engaging with persons with
dementia as filled with potential.
     In this chapter, we explore two scenes from Cracked in order to better
understand our use of the theatrical form to provide such an exploratory and
reflective space. The first scene portrays residents dining in a long-term care
home engaging with each other with humour, mockery, foolishness, kindness,
and even some unkindness. The second shows a health-care provider being
interviewed in comical, heightened film noir style by two “Interrogators” for
using an affectionate term with a resident. We will highlight how the first scene
captures the ways persons living with dementia are theatrically performed as
filled with capacity to engage meaningfully and relationally, and how this sits
in tension with the regulatory landscape of long-term care that suppresses this
capacity in the second scene.
114   Julia Gray, Pia Kontos, Sherr y Dupuis, Gail Mitchell, and Christine Jonas-Simpson


      C racked : B ackground
      Cracked: New Light on Dementia was initiated by authors Sherry Dupuis, Gail
      Mitchell, Pia Kontos, and Christine Jonas-Simpson, all of whom are health
      researchers who specialize in the areas of aging, dementia, and research-in-
      formed performance (as live theatre and/or film).2 These researchers were
      looking for a way to challenge the discourse of tragedy and loss that is
      dominant in relation to dementia and the people who live with it, as well as
      the corresponding dehumanizing care practices that are prevalent in so many
      institutional care settings. With playwright and theatre director Julia Gray as
      artistic leader, the play was developed collaboratively with a group of actors.3
      It emphasizes the centrality of relationships and humanity when providing
      care for persons with dementia and the need to recognize the dynamic and
      fundamental ways in which memory and self-expression are embodied. This
      collaborative play making, or “theatrical devising,” involves an improvised
      creative process among those working in studio (Barton and Wells; Filewod;
      Mitchell). At strategic points throughout our process, we continued to invite
      community members, including persons living with dementia and their family
      members, into rehearsal for open discussion and feedback about what we were
      creating. For example, early on in our process we conducted a full-day arts-
      based workshop where the actors, playwright/director, researchers, and visual
      artists came together with people living with dementia and family members
      to interrogate the tragedy discourse and imagine and construct alternative
      representations based on the lived experiences of people living with dementia
      (S. Dupuis et al., “Re-claiming”). For more information on our development
      process, please see our published script (Collective Disruption).
          Cracked follows two storylines, those of Elaine Carter and Vera Nolan, both
      of whom have been diagnosed with dementia. The play opens with Elaine’s
      diagnosis and follows her journey with her two adult children as they navigate
      their changing relationships. We see Elaine becoming engaged with her commu-
      nity, reconnecting with her longtime friend Vera who has also been diagnosed
      with dementia, becoming a political advocate to improve the lives of persons
      with dementia, and flirting with beautiful young men. A space opens in a
      long-term care home, so Elaine and her family make the decision to move her

      3 | Actors involved in the initial creative process included Susan Applewhaite, Lori
      Nancy Kalamanski, Tim Machin, Mary Ellen MacLean, Mary Claire Frances Muir, Mark
      Prince, and David Talbot. The team would also like to recognize Jerrold Karch for his
      creative contributions.

into this home. From here the journey shifts as Elaine’s world again opens
up to meeting new people and making new friends in the home. Elaine’s
daughter Caroline struggles with her own assumptions of what persons living
with dementia should be like; by the play’s end she is able to spontaneously
dance with her mother. With Vera, the second protagonist, we also witness
her journey with her husband, Tom, as they work through changes in their
relationship. There comes a point when Tom is no longer able to care for Vera,
and she also moves into a long-term care home. As the play moves to the end,
and as Vera progresses further on her dementia journey, we learn about Vera’s
history and life experiences through her sensuous and embodied memories of
dancing, singing, joy, and fear. Through both storylines, the audience sees both
characters who are living with dementia grow and learn, not only despite the
disease but also because of it.



The S cenes
For the purposes of this chapter, below we have included detailed descriptions
of what the actors are doing in the scene, including their posture, facial expres-
sions, quality of movements, and so on, in addition to stage directions and the
spoken text.
    In this way, the following is not a traditional script, which would strictly
adhere to basic stage directions (basic descriptions of where actors move and
what they are doing on stage, such as moving a prop). We include more here to
indicate what is missing in written form, the body and its gestures, as integral
to performance. Our descriptions of actors’ bodies and gestures are also
integral to our arguments about dementia: that we overlook the body and its
gestures because we undervalue them, and we thus overlook how persons with
dementia use their bodies to continue to express and be themselves despite
cognitive memory loss.

SCENE 17 – Dining

Dining room.

During the scene transition, the six chairs are set up as if they are around two square
tables (which are mimed/imagined) along the downstage area. All props, such as mugs of
tea and meals on plates, are mimed.

SILAS, a resident, enters from the upstage right corner. Donning a sweater vest which
hangs open off his shoulders, SILAS walks downstage and clutches each chair as it is
placed around imaginary tables by the other actors. His face filled with intensity and
concentration, he carefully limps as he walks from chair to chair, making his way to the
downstage left table.

ELAINE, vibrant and active, enters from the upstage left corner. As she sees SILAS limp
towards his regular seat at the table, she extends her arm and speeds up towards him so
she can help him sit.

ELAINE         Here you go, Silas.

ELAINE pulls back her own chair at the same table and sits with ease.

JIM, staff of the long-term care home, is helping ESMERELDA, a resident, to the stage
right table. ESMERELDA’s arm his hooked into JIM’S and they are happily chatting to
each other as he leads her to the table. ESMERELDA’s short steps are compounded by the
hunch in her back, which prompts her head to slump forward slightly.

JIM            (as he helps her sit) You’re OK?
ESME           Yes.

JIM bustles off to stage right to check on something in the kitchen.

HENRY, a resident, enters miming using a walker from upstage. As he makes his way
to the stage right table, his steps are small and tight as he relies on the mimed walker to
support him. Sitting with great weight, he nimbly folds his walker and places it behind his
seat. He turns to the others at the table with a big smile.

SARAH, a resident, has entered from upstage right, and walks towards HENRY and
ESME at the stage right table. She saunters into the dining room, gently fiddling with
the edges of her scarf and softly humming to herself. DOROTHY, adjusting her hair and
pearl necklace at her sternum, has meekly entered from upstage left and joins SILAS and
ELAINE at the stage left table.
118   Julia Gray, Pia Kontos, Sherr y Dupuis, Gail Mitchell, and Christine Jonas-Simpson


      Residents acknowledge each other as they sit, some chatter to each other, some just sit and
      smile, some fidget. SARAH continues to hum to herself.

      ELAINE        (with a laugh) I’m so hungry I could eat the leg off the Lamb of God!

      Mortified, DOROTHY crosses herself and begins to pray, and SILAS scoffs at ELAINE’s
      absurdity. JIM enters and stands at the top of the table.

      JIM           So, who’s for tea?
      ELAINE        Oh, me!
      SARAH         (shakes head)
      DOROTHY       (raises hand)
      ESME          Yes.
      JIM           Silas?
      SILAS         Coffee.
      JIM           Henry?

      HENRY, who flirts head to head with ESME, does not respond.

      JIM           Henry?
      HENRY         (looks up in surprise with a big smile) Oh. No thanks.
      JIM           (nodding, anticipating each resident’s preferences) OK, three teas and one
                    coffee (starts to exit).
      ELAINE        And a little sugar into it!

      JIM waves at her as he exits.

      ELAINE        (turns to her ‘audience’ of the other residents with a big smile) So, that guy
                    was so tight, he was tight as a frog. And you know how tight that is?
      ESME          No.
      ELAINE        Water tight! (slaps the imaginary table, laughing)
      ESME          (with a groan) Oh …

      SARAH, HENRY and DOROTHY laugh at ELAINE’s terrible joke.

      SILAS         Sshh!
      JIM           (enters with trolley with tea and coffee, places mugs of coffee or tea, etc, in
                    front of residents). Here you go (to ELAINE), and the sugar. And Silas,
                    coffee, and some bread.

      JIM moves towards the stage right table to serve tea and coffee.
                                                             Dementia (Re)per formed       119


ELAINE       Suffering Jesus, it’s hot! Can I get a little ice to cool it down a bit?
JIM          (places mug of tea in front of ESME) Esme, some tea.
ESME         Thank you.
ELAINE       How about that ice?
JIM          (turning to ELAINE) Just leave it for a minute, it will cool. I need to get
             the meals.
ELAINE       (pushing back her chair to stand) Let me help you there, Jim.
ESME         Yes.

ELAINE gently touches ESME’s shoulder as she walks past, and she and JIM exit
together.

SILAS        (having sipped his coffee, expresses in disgust) Decaf!
HENRY        (with a smile, responding to SARAH’s humming) Oh Sarah, that’s lovely.
ESME         Yes!

DOROTHY quietly adjusts her pearls.

SILAS        Sshh!
ELAINE       (re-entering with something in her hand). Got the butter.

ESME reaches towards ELAINE as she places a plate of butter at the stage right table,
then walks to the stage left table.

ESME         Thank you.
ELAINE       (sitting in her seat, newly discovers the tea with a smile) Oh look, tea,
             that’s nice.

JIM enters with another cart of plates, places the cart between the tables and starts to
serve to the stage left table.

JIM          (to ELAINE as he carefully places the meal in front of her) Here you go.
             Now careful, it’s hot.
ELAINE       (with a wink) Just like you!
ESME         (laughs) Yes!

Everyone laughs.

SILAS        Sshh!
SARAH        (turns in frustration towards SILAS) Sshh!

JIM moves to the stage right table to place meals.

      JIM          (places meal) Sarah … There you go, Esme (places meal).

      ELAINE cheekily starts scooping up large amounts of butter onto her bread.

      DOROTHY (giggles at ELAINE) Oh, you …
      SILAS   (raises his finger in protest) Jim, Jim, uh, she, she’s taking all the butter,
              she’s uh, she’s taking all the …
      JIM     (walks to stage left table) Yes Silas, I can see that, I’ll make sure there’s
              enough for everyone. (to ELAINE) Now, sweetie …

      Everyone freezes and, with heightened postures and expressions of shock, looks to JIM.

      ALL          (dramatic intake of breath) Gasp!



      SCENE 18 – The Interrogation

      As if undercover residents, members of the ENSEMBLE stand and clear the space, scat-
      tering like roaches, except for a chair centre stage and two INTERROGATORS.

      JIM is pushed into the chair by one of the ENSEMBLE. Two INTERROGATORS begin
      their work. INTERROGATOR 1 stands facing JIM from the downstage left corner, and
      INTERROGATOR 2 stands facing JIM in the downstage right corner. They wait until
      there is stillness on stage and the whole ENSEMBLE has exited.

      INT 1        What did you say?
      JIM          (with a look of confusion, like a deer in headlights) What?
      INT 2        (both INTERROGATORS slow and measured, begin to walk towards JIM
                   in the chair) What did you say?
      JIM          When?
      INT 1        Just now.
      JIM          What do you mean?
      INT 1        (The INTERROGATORS have reached JIM in his chair and begin to
                   circle him) You know.
      INT 2        You know what you did.
      JIM          (in his own defense) I was asking Mrs. Carter about the butter.
      BOTH         (stop and turn sharply to look down over JIM in the chair) No.
      INT 2        You called her something.
      JIM          I did?
      INT 1        (still peering down over JIM) Don’t deny it.
      INT 2        (with seething disgust) You have violated the rights of the resident.
                                                         Dementia (Re)per formed      121


INT 1       (with increased anger and passion) Do you know what would happen if
            a compliance officer overheard that?
INT 2       (as the ultimate punishment) We’d get a citation.
JIM         Oh (breaking down under the pressure), OK, I, I called her sweetie. She
            asked me to call her that! (cries)

In situating these two scenes together, both in live performance and in this
chapter, the stark differences between them becomes apparent. In the first
scene, persons with dementia are performed as diverse, including playful,
cheeky, flirtatious, agile, physically limited, musical, spiritual, shy, outgoing,
scornful, frustrated, among a raft of other qualities (and it should be empha-
sized, each person is unique). In the second scene, persons living with dementia
are merely mentioned in the abstract (“the resident”), cast in the shadow of the
Interrogators more concerned with avoiding the wrath of the compliance officer
in the form of a citation.
    In the first scene we see a community of people living with their differ-
ences, supporting, teasing, flirting with and testing each other, getting under
each other’s skin. No one is performed as though an empty shell of their former
self; rather, each resident gestures and expresses themselves uniquely in the
present moment. We see the care-home staff member, Jim, understanding and
supporting each resident’s patterns and needs, knowing who prefers coffee or
tea, creating space for residents to help each other and him, as Elaine does when
she follows Jim to retrieve the butter from the kitchen. But audience members
come to be engaged with this community of people in large part through how
the actors gesture as the residents.
    Sarah saunters toward her seat, humming and fiddling with her scarf;
Elaine extends her arm to help Silas to his seat; Henry brings his head close to
Esme’s while he flirts; Dorothy gently and daintily adjusts her pearls resting on
her sternum: these things are not extraneous additions to the scene to make
it more visually interesting. These gestures are the scene, the way in which
members of this community engage with each other, and the way in which
audiences come to engage with the story, central to which is the importance of
author Pia Kontos’s theoretical notion of embodied self hood. Embodied selfhood
emphasizes the importance of the capacities, senses, and sociocultural disposi-
tions of the body for self-expression, interdependence, and relationality (Kontos
et al., “Citizenship”). Based on her ethnographic research in long-term care
homes with persons living with dementia, she draws upon Merleau-Ponty’s
notion of non-representational intentionality and Bourdieu’s notion of habitus
to argue that despite even severe cognitive impairment, selfhood persists in
and through the body (Kontos, “Ethnographic”; “Embodied”; “Rethinking”;
“Alzheimer”).
122   Julia Gray, Pia Kontos, Sherr y Dupuis, Gail Mitchell, and Christine Jonas-Simpson


          Contrast this with the second scene. While filled with humour, as indi-
      cated by the heightened expressions and postures of the Interrogators, the
      uniqueness of each resident is all but lost in this scene, which focuses on repri-
      manding Jim for using affectionate language – “Sweetie” – with a (nameless to
      the Interrogators) resident. In their admonishment of Jim, what the Interroga-
      tors overlook, of course, is the relationship among residents and between Jim
      and this particular resident, Elaine Carter. The gestures between them in the
      dining scene include gentle teasing with playful language, flirting (“[H]ot …
      Just like you!”), and Elaine helping Jim with some of the serving tasks. While
      Jim is not a resident himself, he is invited and accepted into the community of
      residents by Elaine and the others in part because of his reciprocal engagement
      with them. Jim using the word “sweetie” toward Elaine is not out of context,
      especially as we learn in the interrogation scene that Jim has previously been
      invited to use this term by Elaine when addressing her. He uses this term to
      accept her invitation of being in relation. By relying on a one-size-fits-all policy
      that focuses more on the avoidance of disrespecting an abstract resident, the
      Interrogators focus their energies on also avoiding a citation from a compliance
      officer, thereby negating any relationship between Jim, Elaine, and the other
      residents.
          In this way, the performed gestures of the actors as residents in the dining
      scene – as full human beings living in relation with each other and in place and
      space despite cognitive memory loss – disrupt the abstract resident referred to
      by the Interrogators as a nameless recipient of policy. Through the juxtaposi-
      tion of these two scenes, the policy enforced by the Interrogators is exposed as
      absurd; not only are the Interrogators performed as absurd in their buffoonish
      gestures, their exaggerated walking style, and their over-exerted passion about
      the imposition of policy regulation, but the policy itself, as a social action that
      assumes residents and staff are not able to be in relation with others, also
      becomes exposed as absurd through its enforcement by the Interrogators.
          Both scenes have received a warm reception from audience members. In
      performances there is often laughter in recognition of the nuances of each
      resident in the dining scene, a familiar chuckle in response to particular jokes
      (“Water tight!”), and an affectionate sigh in recognition of forgetful moments
      (“Oh look, tea, that’s nice”). The interrogation brings more robust laughter, and
      post-performance discussions have brought forth comments from audience
      members indicating how the scene allowed them to appreciate the absurdity of
      the “language police.”
          However, participants from a study we conducted4 exploring how audience
      members working in long-term care homes engaged with Cracked highlight the
      specific tensions between attending to relationships and current policy. These

quotations from three different participants beautifully capture the importance
of being in relation with residents and following their lead, as well as the ways
in which policy restricts those possibilities.

The “sweetie thing” to me was the perfect juxtaposition of institutionalized and
person-centred care because institutionally, Ministry standards say that we’re not
allowed to do that. And to me to do person-centred care, you kind of have to be a little
more personal than that. So I find a lot of times the two battle back and forth. (Partici-
pant 1) … when he called her sweetie and they’re going to get the compliance officer and
be cited. And I’m thinking yeah. And you know sometimes you’ve got to be careful, it’s
abuse and all this speaking like that. [But] really, if it comes from the heart, is it abuse?
And these people – like are we all at arm’s length and cold, you know? Like, they need
love. (Participant 2)

Well, like the first thing that the staff member got chastised around was “sweetie,” being
called “sweetie.” And I mean, like I recognize that that can be a fine line either way.
You can dehumanize someone by calling them a term they’re not comfortable with. So
I recognize it can be that reality. But the flip side is often when you’re getting to know
your residents, you know what works for them. And I just trust a lot of our staff that they
get it, that they know what works. Here’s someone you can joke around with and that’s
what they expect. If you’d be all serious with them and hands off-ish, that would not fly.
(Participant 3)

Not only did study participants come to understand the absurdity of the policy
they are restricted by in their daily working life but they each also understood
why the policy might be viewed as extreme; it is extreme because it overlooks
the significance of being in relation as part of being human. We would suggest
that it is through the juxtaposition of the two scenes that policy is seen anew.
Rules enforced by the Interrogators which might be normalized in day-to-day
existence as “the ways things are” become exposed within the frame of the
play precisely because audience members have witnessed positive, attentive
relationships in the previous scene. Study participants reference this through
language such as “you kind of have to be a little more personal than [insti-
tutional/Ministry standards],” “[residents] need love,” and the importance of
“getting to know your residents.” This suggests that these participants, as
people who work with residents in long-term care homes, know and live these
tensions between attending to relationships with residents and policy that
restricts them. However, in seeing these tensions enacted through the play,
participants are provided the aesthetic space to reflect, attending to senses and
emotions in addition to thoughts, and ultimately are able to voice it clearly.

      C onclusion
      In Cracked, and more specifically in The Dining Scene, we disrupt the tragedy
      discourse through the ways persons with dementia are performed. Actors
      playing residents in a long-term care home, all living with dementia, express
      their characters’ uniqueness through their singing, flirting, scoffing, praying,
      giggling, helping, and egging each other on, among other gestures. We see a
      lively community of people engaging with each other, including staff member
      Jim, who supports them and creates space for them to be themselves. Policy for
      its own sake, as a social action concerned with avoiding citations regarding an
      abstract and nameless resident, is then exposed as absurd when it is personi-
      fied by two buffoonish Interrogators. It is through theatre, as an art form that
      attends to emotions, senses, thoughts, and actions in time and space, that an
      aesthetic space is created to invite audience members to reflect on how their
      thoughts, feelings, and senses extend to actions, including representation and
      policy.

The Story of a Theatre Group

Aynsley Moorhouse


This piece is adapted from a weekly online blog that I kept while working with
a group of residents at a long-term care home. Here, we watch a group of nine
older adults transform from strangers and acquaintances into an active and
vibrant theatre company. We see the group members learn theatre techniques,
build strong and lasting connections, support each other in their creative
expressions, and work together for a common goal: to develop and ultimately
perform a piece of theatre. This blog chronicles the theatre company from
its first rehearsal to its final performance for approximately 200 audience
members at Baycrest Health Sciences in Toronto. It showcases the power of
theatre to bring great individual joy and growth, to build strong relationships
and communities, and to create – even in small ways – social change.
    I would like to acknowledge funding support from the Ontario Arts Council,
an agency of the Government of Ontario.

20 March 2012

I’m Aynsley Moorhouse, and next week I will be launching a theatre and digital
storytelling program for residents of the Apotex Nursing Home at Baycrest
Health Sciences in Toronto, Canada. Baycrest is an “academic health sciences
centre” providing care for “older adults across a variety of institutional and
community-based settings.” In their Mission, the organization states that they
are “devoted to improving the quality of life of older adults everywhere through
the integration and application of exceptional healthcare, wellness promotion,
research, and educational activities” (Mission, Vision and Values). I am working
closely with two Recreation Therapists and the Department of Culture, Arts
and Innovation, and I am very thankful for this support.
128   Aynsley Moorhouse


      My training and background is in theatre; I have an MFA in Acting from The
      New School in New York City, and an MA in Theatre Studies from the Univer-
      sity of Toronto. My passion is for working with older adults and people who live
      with dementia. Over the last eight years I have worked as an actor, dramaturge,
      writer, and teaching artist with people of all ages and with varying levels of
      physical and cognitive abilities.
          Next Wednesday, after months of programming, scheduling, researching,
      and recruiting residents and staff, the theatre group will hold our first
      rehearsal. We’ll be working toward developing a devised piece1 of theatre to be
      performed for staff and family members at Baycrest. The piece will be created
      collaboratively during our weekly rehearsals and in one-on-one meetings and
      will be constructed entirely from the participants’ words, ideas, and stories.
      We’re incorporating digital storytelling into the project: I’m going to be
      meeting with residents individually to make several short films about their
      lives. As yet, I only have a rough idea of what shape this project will take – that
      will depend on the interests, goals, strengths, and stories of the participants
      in the group.



      A nd W e ’re O ff !
      28 March 2012

      Today was the official launch of the Apotex Theatre Group. I’ve already learned
      a lot! Knowing that the first day of any group project can be a bit scary and
      daunting for everyone (myself included), I thought it would be helpful to begin
      with a long introduction. I was so wrong.
          My main mistake was overestimating how much I would need to … well …
      talk. I could have gone on for the whole hour (and I think I half intended to)
      about how excited I am about this project, about all the possibilities and my
      many plans, about the impact we can have, and about my training, but the
      people came to the group to do – not to sit around listening to me jabber …
      about myself. So I stumbled over my words for a few minutes too many before
      looking up to uninterested stares. I put down my notes, got up on my feet, and
      shut up.
          We began by discussing possible themes and topics that we could explore
      over the next several months. Family, loss, war, friendship, community, aging,
      and life in the Apotex are all themes that were brought up by the group, mostly
      highlighted by personal anecdotes.




      1 | See Gray et al. in this volume, p. 111, for explanation of “devising.”
                                                           “Hooray for You and Me”     129


    I discovered that we have a poet in the group, or rather, according to him, a
former poet. His name is Barry.2
    “I used to be a poet,” Barry said, to which I replied, “I would love if you
might try writing again, for our play.” He sat for a moment without saying
anything, but then, just as I was about to gently change the subject, he said
quietly, “Yes. Yes, I would like that.”
    I should add that this is the same gentleman who, at the end of the session
said to me, “I am starting to get a glimmer of interest in this project. Just a
glimmer. See you next week.” This left me feeling hopeful … I think.
    We also discussed what we are each hoping to gain from our time together.
One woman, Fiona, said simply, “I’m here to learn how to act.” Tom said, “I
was a lawyer my whole life, and now I want to use my performing skills in the
theatre.” A woman who expressed feeling isolated said, “I would like to expand
my community and get to know some of my neighbours better.” Near the end
of this discussion, Ned, who wants to work with me on a more directorial level,
said, “I know that the people in this room have a lot to say. I want the rest of the
world to know that too.”
    We ended the rehearsal with a brief introduction to improvisation. I started
to explain how great a tool it is for generating stories and encouraging sponta-
neity, but again, I lost the interest of the group. So instead of talking on and on,
I briefly explained the rules for the game Fortunately/Unfortunately so that we
could give it a try. In this game, one player begins a story with the word “Fortu-
nately.” The next person adds to the story, beginning with “unfortunately …”
The next person adds, beginning with “fortunately …,” and so on.
    Everyone had something rich and beautiful to add to our story. There was
no plot, characters, or consistency of narrative, and I found this incredibly
exciting. The urgency and enthusiasm with which each person added to the
story was inspiring. It was during this game that I finally began to relax.
    After the game was done, Tom gestured for the microphone (some of the
participants have difficulty hearing so we use one in our rehearsals), and asked
if he could do both a “fortunately” and an “unfortunately.” I said, “of course!”
    “Fortunately, you are wearing a lovely black sweater.” I looked down at my
top that has a very high neckline in front but scoops quite low in the back.
    “Well thank you!”
    “Unfortunately, you are wearing it backwards.”
    There was a pause, and then the group erupted into uncontrollable laughter.
I turned the brightest red. And on that joyful and horribly embarrassing note,
our first rehearsal was over.

      The y C ame B ack !
      7 April 2012

      I arrived at the second rehearsal of the Apotex Theatre Group half an hour early.
      When I walked in I found that Tom was already there.
          He had come early because during the week he had written three pages of
      a script for our performance. He said that now, when he can’t sleep at night, he
      writes. He had found a straightforward way to merge the giant topics of “life at
      the Apotex” and “life before the Apotex.” We spoke of exploring ways in which
      they feed each other.
          Once everyone else arrived we began talking about what will probably be
      a major theme of our performance – the community at the Apotex – and then
      Tom read his script and explained his ideas. The response from the group was
      supportive and enthusiastic, and we tossed around a few ideas. I think we are
      going to work well together.
          After our discussion we dove right into some vocal acting exercises.
          I was a little nervous about this. The group members – none of whom have
      a background in theatre – are fun and adventurous, but they are also quite
      serious. I am a trained actor, so I am accustomed to doing strange and some-
      times playful or silly exercises, but I take them pretty seriously. I was hoping
      the group members would understand this and might feel the same way, but I
      wasn’t sure they would.
          I had nothing to be worried about. By joining the group, everyone seems to
      have made a decision to trust the process and to go along for the ride.
          And boy were we LOUD!
          An energy game that I brought in was also a success. Usually in this exercise
      the person with the “energy” makes eye contact with whoever is next to them,
      and then gestures with their hands (often with a clap) that they are “passing the
      energy” until it makes its way around the whole circle. This is how I demon-
      strated the exercise.
          Once we started, however, a beautiful thing happened. Instead of simply
      making eye contact and gesturing, each person tightly grasped the hands of the
      person next to them as they passed the energy. This continued almost all the
      way around the circle. It was a joy to watch and to be a part of.
          I wanted to make the idea of “our final performance” something tangible
      and to give the group an idea of the sort of thing we could do, so I showed a
      video of a scene created and performed by a theatre group at a retirement home.
      The scene we watched dealt with how a person’s sense of identity can shift upon
      moving into a retirement or nursing home.
          The discussion following this scene was a balanced mix of the positive and
      the negative. One woman said that she felt great upon arriving at Baycrest and
      was excited by all the arts and cultural programming. Some people talked about
                                                        “Hooray for You and Me”    131


the strong sense of community they have discovered. Others said that they have
felt lonely since arriving. A few people who have been living here longer were
able to assure some newer residents that it can take time to settle in. Everyone
had something to say on this topic, and we all agreed that this group provides
an effective forum for exploring both the good and the bad freely and without
judgement.



Try U s
15 April 2012

When writing about her TimeSlips storytelling program in Forget Memory:
Creating Better Lives for People with Dementia, Anne Basting stresses the
importance of greeting each participant individually at the beginning of every
session. I’ve made a commitment to doing this with my group each week. It
sounds so simple, but I’ve found it very helpful for building a rapport with
group members and for ensuring that everyone feels welcome and a part of the
group.
    After relaxation and vocal exercises and a quick game of Fortunately/Unfor-
tunately, we tried playing The Counting Game. In this game, a group stands or
sits, usually in a circle. Anyone can call out “one” and then any other person
can call out “two” and so on. If at any time two people call out a number at the
same time, the counting starts at “one” again. When I play this game, the goal
is usually to get to ten.
    This game requires great concentration and can create a lovely sense of
calm and unity within a group. I explained the rules and then asked everyone
to close their eyes, relax, and for someone to call out the number “one” if and
when they had the impulse to do so.
    During the first round one number was called out of turn (I think we got
to 4 when someone called out 7). For the next round I changed it up: “Call
out any number you like. Be impulsive.” And they did. 27. 14. 58. For some
reason, hearing numbers called out at random like this was … beautiful. Those
of us in the room who were not participating (volunteers and one resident’s
granddaughter) were all moved. Something special happened when we allowed
ourselves to let go of our ideas of what the game was “supposed to” be.
    We spent most of our rehearsal coming up with a fictional story about
someone moving into a long-term care home. We gave her a name (Marilyn), a
past, and talked about her decision to move there. We talked about how she and
her family members each felt about the move and why. We discussed Marilyn’s
fears about the move, her arrival and first day, and her conflicting emotions.
We talked about her first meal, her bedroom, and her first (sleepless) night in
her new bed.
132   Aynsley Moorhouse


          This conversation went on for over half an hour. It was dynamic, detailed,
      and truthful. It seemed as though working with a fictional character gave
      everyone the freedom to discuss his or her own experiences and conflicting
      emotions. Everybody had something to say and it felt as though there wasn’t a
      moment to breathe.
          In the last ten minutes I asked the group if they would each share some-
      thing they’ve learned about themselves since moving here.
          Tom said that since joining our group he’s discovered that he loves play-
      writing and that it’s a great pleasure and comfort for him. Fay was very sociable
      before moving in but misses living alone and is having a little trouble adjusting
      to always having people around. Nadine had always lived a very active life and
      was surprised to discover how much she enjoys living quietly now. Not all of the
      responses were so positive. Some people have been feeling lost, and some were
      surprised at their own negativity.
          I think the group is beginning to trust me. I shared my concern that they
      might think some of my acting exercises were silly. Barry responded, “Try us.”
          As I was cleaning up, one member’s granddaughter who had sat in on our
      rehearsal asked if she could speak with me. She wanted to tell me how much
      she loved the session and was so happy to see her grandmother being part of
      a group like this. She thinks that this sort of model could change the types of
      programs that are available in nursing homes. I hope so.



      A P le asure
      23 April 2012

      In the last couple of weeks, members of the group have been coming forward
      to express how they want to be involved in our project. Tom is working on his
      script and is incorporating the group discussions into the text, and Ned would
      like to work in a directorial role. I’m sure that in the next few weeks everyone’s
      desired roles will begin to emerge.
          At our second rehearsal, Barry brought me some of his poems to read. They
      are beautiful. He wants to recite some in the production and has agreed to
      let me record him reading a few of them. Last Thursday we met to choose
      our favourite poems and to begin recording. In the recordings he is at times
      hesitant, confident, forgetful, angry with himself, and proud. He invited me
      over again next week so I can bring the edited versions of the poems for him
      to review.
          For the digital storytelling aspect of the project, I will be meeting one-on-one
      with residents who are not members of the theatre group, to record their stories.
      Together we are choosing images and music which will be combined with the
      stories to create short films.
                                                         “Hooray for You and Me”    133


    So far I’ve had three meetings with a gentleman named Edward, and I have
approximately two hours of usable material for a project that is supposed to be
three or four minutes in length. The stories we will use for the final product
are about his time in the war and about his wife, Sophia. The recordings are
full of beautiful detail, passion, and humour. His love for Sophia is clear and
staggering.
    Last week I ran into Edward in the main hall of the Apotex. “Hello my
friend!” he called when he saw me. With him was a beautiful older woman.
“This is Sophia.” I squeezed her hand to say how happy I was to meet her, and
she held onto my hand tightly for the whole half hour that I sat chatting with
them.
    Sophia doesn’t say much, but her energy is amazing and it was such a
pleasure to spend that time with them. We talked, they sang, and Edward told
her some of the stories he had shared with me. While he spoke Sophia looked
into his eyes with such trust and love. When I got up to leave, Sophia held my
hand even more tightly, looked me in the eyes, and simply said, “A pleasure!”



A c - cent- tchu - ate The P ositive!
1 May 2012

As usual, we began with a game of Fortunately/Unfortunately, and this time
I asked the group members to choose a pre-determined activity and setting
for the story before we got started. This is a common practice in improvisa-
tion, and can provide structure and direction for a story or scene. Nadine and
Nora came up with “voting in Manitoba.” Before we got going I said, “I’m from
Manitoba!” to which a few people jokingly said how sorry they were. During
the game some participants took the opportunity to say nice things about my
home province (a province which, I should note, I love very much), but not
everybody was so kind.
    Tom said, “Unfortunately Manitoba feels like it’s squeezed between two
covers. It’s got provinces on either side and doesn’t have anywhere to go.”
Norman said, “Fortunately I live far away from Manitoba and can’t go. I have
many places to go before. To vote … that’s too far for me.” Ned said he would hop
on a plane tomorrow to go to Manitoba and vote because “it’s important that
everyone should vote, and I’m going to go back there for that reason.”
    Every week I start with breathing and relaxation and I go around lightly
touching my hands to each person’s shoulders and neck to aid with the relax-
ation. Whenever I’m in a yoga or acting class I absolutely love when the teacher
places her hands on me to assist my relaxation or stretch. So I thought, why
wouldn’t I do that here? I think the need for physical contact is universal.
134   Aynsley Moorhouse


          Before I go around I always ask the members of the group to gesture if they
      would not like to be touched, but so far nobody has done so. I can often feel
      people’s shoulders relaxing with my touch.
          When I introduced vocal exercises in the first week, most people partic-
      ipated quietly and tentatively, so I’ve been focusing on volume and support.
      Over the last month the group has been getting louder and more enthusiastic,
      and we are working on supporting our voices from the diaphragm rather than
      from the throat.
          After these exercises we moved on to the Counting Game again, and this
      time right from the start I said to impulsively call out any number in any
      random order. Success.
          Then I said, call out the numbers as though you are very angry. Then happy.
      Then embarrassed. The work was subtle but focused and animated, as the
      actors demonstrated their emotional range.
          Next we played What Are You Doing. For this exercise, one person begins
      miming an action. For example, she may pretend to be brushing her teeth. Then
      the next person asks, “what are you doing?” and first person keeps miming that
      she is brushing her teeth and says a different action. For example, “I’m washing
      my car.” The asker then begins miming washing his car, and then another
      person asks him, “what are you doing?” and so on. In playing this game, I discov-
      ered that the group is itching to interact with improvised dialogue – and they
      are really good at it. All the pairs got into a back and forth dialogue (another
      example of letting go of the rules), and every scene was clever – some were even
      laugh out loud funny.

      Nora: What are you doing?
      Nadene: I’m putting cream on my face.
      Nora: Lovely! Are you going out?
      Nadene: Yes, I always like to look good.

      Ned: Norman, what are you doing?
      Norman: Sitting watching the group here.
      Ned: That’s very nice of you to watch the group and I hope you get a lot of pleasure
      from it.
      Norman: For sure yes.
      Ned: Ok.

      The game did not call for any dialogue. Rather, this all happened organically,
      and I would say out of a need for creative expression and interaction.
          After these scenes, the group shared tactics that they use to remain positive
      in their day-to-day lives. Last week I had asked them to prepare for a discussion
      of this topic.
                                                               “Hooray for You and Me”      135


     The responses were diverse: some were practical, some were anecdotal, and
Barry’s response came in the form of a song (“You’ve got to accentuate the
positive! Eliminate the negative! …”)! Norman said, “I’m happy to come here
to stay with the group and learn so much about theatre. I’m always happy to
come here, close to each other.” This comment speaks to Norman’s desire for
lifelong learning, meaningful interactions, and creative expression. These core
human needs do not just disappear as we age or when we move to a long-term
care home.
     Fiona wasn’t able to make it this week, but she left us a poem to read in
response to my question. The poem is about aging, and it is positive and funny
and sad and truthful and brave all at once. We discussed using the poem in the
play and here’s what a few people said about the poem:

Ned: I think she’s making fun of herself in her poem. In the different words that she
uses. You can think of it as derogatory but it’s not. It’s really … how it is today … and
how she’s overcoming the thoughts that may come out in the play.
Barry: We’re all old people and we always talk about the shape we’re in, so that poem
can set the tone of the play to come.

Near the end of rehearsal, I asked everyone if they could share something about
themselves that they would like the audience to know. I gave an example of a
story Katherine had shared with us two weeks before, but in my retelling I got
some of the details wrong. Norman and Ned immediately corrected me. Ned
then elaborated, and shared his thoughts and emotions about Katherine’s story,
citing specific details. The people in this group are listening to each other,
absorbing what is being said, and reflecting on it.
    Once everyone started speaking about themselves as I’d asked, Ned took the
opportunity to speak not about himself but about his Personal Support Worker
whom he greatly admires. His speech was generous and passionate, and by the
time he was done, the Personal Support Worker was in tears.



B ingo!
8 May 2012

During our relaxation work this week, I ask everyone to begin breathing slowly
and deeply, close their eyes, and imagine sitting in a peaceful place. I always
give the example of a beach, and explain that during this exercise I like to
imagine the way the sun feels on my body, the smell of the ocean, the sounds
of the waves and the seagulls … in other words, I ask them to imaginatively
engage all of their senses.
136   Aynsley Moorhouse


          A few of the vocal exercises we’ve been doing involve everyone making
      some funny sounds, like “ay yay yay!” and “yo ya yo ya.” Before we all chanted
      “ga ga ga ga,” I joked that we were about to make sounds like a baby, and I heard
      one participant say, “No way.” I think she felt that making those sounds would
      be demeaning and I entirely understand and respect that. When we were done I
      mentioned that if anyone is uncomfortable with an exercise for any reason they
      can feel free to hold back without fear of upsetting me. I want everyone to be at
      ease with the work we are doing.
          Because of last week’s success with What Are You Doing, I decided to try a
      different improvisational game that invites back and forth banter: First Liners,
      where one person in a pair is given the opening line for a scene, and then they
      improvise a scene from there. As could be expected, the game was great and
      there were some real hits.
          One example:

      Barry: I love this song.
      Norman: Sing it to me.
      Barry: A gaba bo daba! (Barry sings)
      Norman: Very good!
      Barry: I just made that up!
      Norman: Oh – I know.

      We laugh a lot in our rehearsals now, and on three occasions someone has
      spontaneously broken into song.



      M emories R e visited
      15 May 2012

      This week while everyone was arriving for rehearsal, there was easy banter and
      joking about our show, our lives, our ages (I have a birthday coming up), and
      our families. It felt like the beginning of rehearsal for any theatre production.
      We’ve become a company.
          After everyone had settled in, a few people shared longer stories about their
      pasts. There has been a lot of talk about a large portion of the presentation
      being a retrospective of the members’ lives, and this has spurred much contem-
      plation, writing, and sharing.
          Fay has been particularly enthusiastic about this portion of the performance.
      She ran a restaurant in Toronto and has spoken about it a number of times in
      rehearsal. She’s brought in photographs and menus and was very happy when
      I suggested that we meet one-on-one next week to work out a monologue about
      this time in her life.
                                                           “Hooray for You and Me”     137


     This week I asked her to give us a setting for Fortunately/Unfortunately, and
she chose the restaurant. I then asked her to begin the exercise with a “fortu-
nately,” but instead of contributing just a sentence or two she gave us the story
of how her restaurant came to be.
     I was delighted that she was sharing this story, but while she spoke I felt a
familiar itch – the stress of knowing that an exercise isn’t going as planned. It’s
a need to have control – and I happily just let it go. I’ve loved the way the exer-
cises change depending on how the participants respond and react. This group
is teaching me the important art of letting go of my plans and expectations, and
I’m discovering that this is where the beauty and magic lie.
     The challenge then became how to get the exercise back on track when
Fay was done speaking. I did it unsuccessfully. I edited her story, and made a
one-line (mis)interpretation of it. I basically made it my own. After thanking
her for sharing the story, I said, “so … fortunately we’ve bought a restaurant
because we want to make people smile.” She didn’t let me take over her words
like that. She answered, “I don’t know anything about business! Fortunately it
worked out very very well!”
     So. Our story. We bought a restaurant, and even though we didn’t know
anything about business it worked out very well. We had a slow start because
the space was small and we didn’t have many customers, but the food was really
good, and as people got to know us, they kept coming back for more. Unfortu-
nately our customer base mostly only spoke Yiddish, and our staff spoke other
languages, so there was a communication breakdown, but nevertheless there
was constantly a lineup out the door.
     We had some great scenes during First Liners this week:

Nora: When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
Ned: How much should I make?
Nora: Just enough for yourself, I don’t want any.
Ned: Oh come on, you have to try a little bit.
Nora: If you mix it with vodka.
Ned: Vodka goes very good with it, so I’ll put vodka in it for you.
Nora: With the vodka I’ll take it. Lemonade and vodka sounds good to me.

With just a few minutes left I checked in with the group to get some feedback
on the work we are doing and to see if they had any questions or comments.
Here are the responses I received:

Ned: I like it!
Tom: It’s damn hard work.
Nora: I didn’t know we were going to do a production, so maybe I’m just getting used
to the idea. I like coming here. We’ll see what happens next.
138   Aynsley Moorhouse


      Barry: I really don’t know where it’s going, but we’ll see in the next few weeks.
      Ned: We trust you.
      Fiona: I think everything’s great.
      Fay: I wonder how it’s all going to turn out.



      I’ll R e ad
      23 May 2012

      Before rehearsal I met with Fay to work on her monologue. During our meeting
      I discovered that she is a poet and songwriter. Much of her work is very
      personal, and I’m not sure yet whether she will be willing to share anything in
      the performance, but I hope so. I’m learning that these one-on-one sessions are
      invaluable, and I will need to meet with everyone in the coming weeks. I have
      to admit, this is a much larger project than I ever would have imagined.
          Fortunately/Unfortunately went around the circle twice this week – not at
      my urging, but simply because the story just kept on going: “Fortunately a very
      beautiful girl married a very handsome man.” Unfortunately, according to Tom,
      “he was already married.” Not to worry, they got married anyway. Of course,
      there were “consequences” on their first night together, according to Fay, but
      “fortunately they had got a good lawyer who straightened them out,” said Fiona.
      Unfortunately, continued Katherine, “the handsome man had a pimple on his
      chin.” But fortunately the pharmacy was open and he could get some “depim-
      pling” ointment. But, added Nora, if she really loved him, the pimple wasn’t
      going to make that much of a difference. “What’s a pimple?” concluded Kath-
      erine diplomatically, giving the story the final word.
          After our relaxation and vocal exercises we did some choral speaking,
      using the poem that Fiona brought us a few weeks ago, and we worked on tech-
      nique, subtext, and expression. I had always assumed that when the speaker in
      the poem says that she “is feeling fine,” she says so in earnest, but the group
      disagreed with me, saying that this line should be read with cynicism. With
      this simple choice, the poem has more of an arc, and tells a more compelling
      story.
          For the last twenty minutes we read a portion of Tom’s play. I gave copies
      of the script to Tom and to two other women who had expressed interest in
      reading it. We needed one more actor, and I asked the group if there was anyone
      else who would be willing to read a part. There were no responses.
          “Nora,” I said, “would you like to read it or would you rather I did it?”
          “No, it’s ok,” she replied.
          “Oh ok, that’s fine,” I said, thinking she meant that she didn’t want to read
      and not wanting to push. Nora was hesitant about joining the group in the begin-
      ning, and I have been so happy to have her come in and participate each week.
                                                          “Hooray for You and Me”    139


   “I’ll read,” she said. My heart leapt.
   So, for the next twenty minutes, four members of the Apotex Theatre
Group did a cold reading of a brand new play written by one of our members.
Everyone – staff, volunteers, and group members – was blown away.
   After discussing the play, Nora said angrily, “Can I please say something?”
I was worried. She continued, smiling mischievously: “Last week you told us
your birthday was coming up and I think you said it was today, but we forgot to
wish you a happy birthday.”
   I hated telling her it was next week, but said I was so happy that she remem-
bered. “Yes, I remembered,” she replied with a smile. And with that, we all said
our goodbyes and left for the day.



B re athe
29 May 2012

This week I had two minor setbacks. One involved a new digital storytelling
participant expressing concerns about sharing her story publicly; the other
involved someone being uncomfortable and unhappy with the sound of his
voice on a digital recording.
    I was feeling defeated. Luckily, on my way out of the building, I got a chance
to speak with Bianca Stern, who leads the Culture, Arts & Innovation Depart-
ment at Baycrest. I told her what had happened. She gave me some really sound
advice.
    First: Breathe.
    Second, she reminded me that these individuals are putting themselves and
their stories out there in a way that many of them never have done before, and
that of course they are going to feel vulnerable and scared sometimes. All I can
do is respect that and be sensitive to their reactions.
    She suggested finding ways to ensure that the new participant feels that she
is in control of the recordings and has agency over her stories, and suggested
ways of making the other person more familiar with the sound of his voice. As
anyone who has heard their voice on a recording knows, it sounds very different
than it sounds in your head. It can be disconcerting to anyone.
    Most importantly for me, she told me not to take these reactions personally.
Just breathe.
    This week the group surprised me with a little birthday party! It was
wonderful. We all got cake and everyone sang Happy Birthday. I was so happy.
    By the time we were done partying it was almost time to go, so we did some
choral speaking, chatted a little, and then said our goodbyes.
    Until next week!

      Rehearsal was great this week. Fortunately/Unfortunately was funny and
      animated as usual; we played First Liners again; and we played One Word Story
      for the first time (similar to One Sentence Story, but each participant contributes
      just one word to create the group story). People sometimes contributed just a
      word, but often added a whole phrase or just a sound. It worked beautifully,
      quickly, and with incredible momentum:

         I have a dog.
         Once upon a
         time
         poor animal
         dog,
         dogs are good.
         bow!
         wow!
         Cat
         meow
         Afraid
         I don’t like cats
         Or
         Anybody else
         Jump
         High!
         Don’t fall
         Can’t escape
         Or
         Or injure my nape
         Went out
         For fun
         I laugh
         My dog does too
         Or
         Or he thinks he does!
         I smile
         My dog giggles
         And
         I don’t believe it
         Or
         He takes Setlas Powders.

   Come over and see it!
   Right!
   What time can you make it?
   Very early in the morning
   Seven
   The dogs have been out chasing cats all night
   It’s too late!
   It’s never too late.
   Call the dog in.
   He doesn’t like that!
   Or
   He doesn’t like being called.
   I’ll tell you something else:
   He chases the cat.
   Happy days are here-
   Not with dogs and cats.
   Again.
   End of story.

I recovered from last week’s setbacks, but I left this week’s rehearsal with some
doubts raised by the group members about whether or not we can pull this off.
I know these doubts are unfounded … but there’s still a little voice in my head
that says, what if we can’t?
    One question that was brought up was why we’ve been playing improv
games every week when we are supposed to be preparing for a performance.
I should have explained this to the group earlier. I know that we’re warming
up our imaginations, learning performance techniques, breaking down inhibi-
tions, and getting creative. We’re exploring our impulses, and getting to know
each other’s. We’re building a company. To me, the link to the performance is
clear, but it wouldn’t be as clear to the group members.
    The digital aspect of the project is taking much more time than I had antic-
ipated, and I’m experiencing some setbacks. One of my participants was happy
to share her stories with me but didn’t want anything to be recorded. I under-
stand entirely, and we spent a lovely hour together, telling each other stories of
our lives. Another woman has agreed to make a digital story, but she is nervous
and doesn’t know whether to trust me or not. She has said that she’s not sure
that she will like the piece in the end, and I’ve told her that if she does not want
the piece to be shared, it won’t be.
    I keep telling myself that all I can do is try, and know that the process of
creating the piece is just as important as the product.
    I need to *breathe* and remain focused on all of the positives.

          For instance, the theatre group members are becoming more ambitious,
      creative, and animated while in rehearsal, and they have all told me that they
      enjoy coming.
          Also, some friendships have developed between people who met in the
      group! Katherine and Norman often joke together affectionately, and this week
      they did a little hula dance together during a luau in Fortunately/Unfortunately.
      When it was her turn to speak, Katherine said, “Unfortunately Norman wasn’t
      in Honolulu with us!” Then she sighed, “Oh Norman. My Norman.”
          After rehearsal one day, Barry was going to go outside to enjoy the sun,
      and Nora said that she would like to join him. Barry replied that he would
      be delighted. Smiling, Nora turned to me and said, “we seem to enjoy each
      other very much. I just met him here.” Barry agreed with her, and then she
      continued, “It’s just nice talking to someone who you enjoy.” She then said, “I
      sort of feel like we’re here to get to know each other. Before I got here I didn’t
      know any of these people …”
          At the end of the day, we’re here for the experience of getting to know each
      other, and hopefully, for our audience to get to know us a little too. We’re here
      to explore a new skill set, to have fun, to exercise different parts of our brains,
      to be creative, and to be heard.



      Q ualit y over Q uantit y
      12 June 2012

      Over the last few weeks, Tom and I have been editing his script, and he gave
      me permission to do some cutting and reorganizing on my own. So I shortened
      it to what I thought would be a manageable length and brought the script to
      rehearsal this week for a full cast read-through.
           Tom was a little disappointed with some of the cuts that I had made, and I
      felt quite badly. Each part of this play is precious and meaningful to him, and
      he’s been up late many nights working on it. It can be difficult and unnerving
      to work with an editor or dramaturge, and maybe it would be best for us to do
      any major cuts together from now on. I don’t want to run the risk of taking
      ownership of it.
           Earlier this week I called a meeting with the two Recreation Therapists who
      I’ve been working with to get a sense of how they think the program is going
      so far. They assured me that so far it’s been a great success, and gave me some
      advice. They said that the participants are keen to have a sense of how the final
      project will look, and suggested that the best way to address this would be to
      help the participants see the project visually.
           So next week I’m going to bring in a giant roll of paper, so we can make a
      timeline of the one-hour performance. As a group, we’ll come up with the order
                                                          “Hooray for You and Me”     143


of events. The suggestion was to be as specific as possible and plan it down to
minute detail.
    The other big piece of advice was to focus our rehearsals entirely on the
show from now on. This means no more Fortunately/Unfortunately or improv
games, and it means having just a short and precise warm-up period.
    I’ve decided that, moving forward, I will only be working with the theatre
group members to create the digital storytelling aspect of the project, rather
than recruiting other residents as I had originally planned. I think I expected
everyone to trust me immediately and to jump at the opportunity to tell me all
of their personal stories. As I’ve mentioned, that has not always been the case.
The members of the theatre group have already had time to learn to trust me,
and they are keen to share their stories.

Today we created our visual timeline of the performance. This is what we came
up with:
    Seven of the nine members will be doing monologues. Tom isn’t doing one
because he feels that his stories are best told in the play he wrote, and Ned is
participating in the group as a director rather than as a performer. He has said
on numerous occasions that he is interested in helping others tell their stories
rather than in telling his own.
    About half of the participants have already written a monologue, and the
others will have theirs finished by the end of June. I’ve met with everyone
privately at least once to work on these, and I hope to create digital stories with
each participant in addition to developing the live monologues.
    We will then read the poem that Fiona brought in, and will end our perfor-
mance with Tom’s play. Tom is comfortable with doing an excerpt of it rather
than trying to cut down the whole play, and we will have printed copies of the
full play for audience members to pick up on their way out.
    The digital components of the performance will happen sporadically
throughout the hour. These are: three of Barry’s poems and Edward’s digital
story.
    We’ve decided that the actors will have their scripts on stage with them,
as we don’t want to worry about memorization. There are two actors who have
visual impairments, so we will need to come up with a solution for them.
    After making the timeline we still had fifteen minutes of rehearsal left,
so I took everyone through a quick physical and vocal warm-up, and then we
practiced our choral speaking with Fiona’s poem. When we were done going
through it once, Barry said, “That sounded pretty ragged.”

          He wasn’t lying. I’m hoping we can rehearse it enough with everyone
      speaking in unison, but if it doesn’t work, we’ll have to come up with some-
      thing else. We’ll see what happens.



      H oor ay for H olly wood!
      26 June 2012

      There are only five rehearsals left until our performance, and – as luck would
      have it – we had to cancel our rehearsal this week. In fact, all programs were
      cancelled because there was an illness going around on our floor, and the
      people who live on that floor were unable to meet with me.
          Three participants who live in a different area were still able to meet.
          A major piece of business we discussed was creating a title for our perfor-
      mance. Katherine came up with, “Hooray for Hollywood!” Ned loved that,
      suggesting that “Hooray for You and Me!” may be more appropriate for our
      group. We then added the subtitle, “An Evening of Theatre.”
          I have been concerned about Ned having enough to do for the final perfor-
      mance, because although he has a directorial role in the group, I really would
      like him to be on stage. This week he voiced that he would like to introduce the
      performance to the audience.
          At one of our first rehearsals he had said, “I know that the people in this
      room have a lot to say, and I want the rest of the world to know that too.” His
      words to the audience will, no doubt, be very powerful.
          I have also been concerned that those participants who have visual impair-
      ments wouldn’t be able to read a monologue on stage, but we’re beginning to
      solve that problem too.
          When Nadine and I met one-on-one last week, we wrote her story out, chose
      a few key points which she memorized, and practiced a few times. Now she is
      able to improvise the whole thing while hitting those key points. We’ve come up
      with a few questions that I ask her to move her onto the next point.
          My fingers are crossed that programs are back on next week, and that the
      group will be able to meet.



      Two M ore W eeks A way
      10 July 2012

      Well, our last rehearsal was in fact cancelled due to the illness, and then to top
      it all off, I had to travel home this past week to visit my family. So … our group
      hasn’t met in almost a month.
                                                          “Hooray for You and Me”     145


    I feel good about where we are, but I’m anxious to get the group back
together again. Instead of the rehearsal, I had some one-on-ones. I met with
Nora to finalize her monologue. She has expressed concerns to me over the
last few months that her stories aren’t interesting, but if only she knew! Her
monologue is terribly charming and touching – it’s the story of how she and
her husband met and fell in love as teenagers … I don’t want to give too much
away, but I’ll just say that it includes some confessions about breaking the rules
at a summer sleep-away camp.
    With just a month left, I’ve had a lot of planning to do, so most of my time
has been spent on coordinating the performance, publicity, technical require-
ments, organizing a reception, et cetera. In order to ensure that I keep on top of
all of this while mostly focusing on the artistic side of the project, I’ve brought
a Production Assistant on board.
    Our assistant, Grace Smith, is working on her PhD in theatre, and is a play-
wright, director, and dramaturge. I’m really looking forward to working with
her.
    Until next week!



A nd … W e ’re B ack !
17 July 2012

Our first rehearsal back was really productive – we fired through everything we
needed to accomplish. I think everyone feels that since we lost so much time
we’ve really got to hustle. There is a buzz in the air nowadays!
    We quickly went over the schedule of events for the performance, did some
warm ups, and then went right into working on our choral speaking.
    After some humming and hawing we decided to try having each person
recite two lines on their own, one after the other. It sounded and looked
amazing. We all agreed that we preferred it this way. Not only does it sound
clearer, but each actor has a chance to showcase their expression and acting
skills. It’s also quite neat to see how each person approaches the text differ-
ently.
    A few people shared their monologues, and then we went through Tom’s
play, Changing Your Lifestyle. Since I hadn’t been able to meet with Tom in such
a long time, I had to make an executive decision on which sections of the play
will be read during the performance. Almost everyone was happy with the
reading and with the sections that I chose. Most importantly, Tom was very
pleased.
    As we were leaving, I told the group about the private reception that will
follow the final performance – it’s a reception just for us – and everyone was
146   Aynsley Moorhouse


      delighted. We will have a champagne toast with petit fours, and lots of hugs and
      tears and goodbyes, I am sure.
          Then Fiona expressed a concern, asking, “What will we do with all the
      people who came to see us perform? Will we just kick them out?” She’s right,
      this may be a problem. The audience members will most certainly want to
      spend time with us after the show.
          Katherine said, “We’ll just say … ‘Au Revoir!’”
          Problem solved.
          When I met one-on-one with Fay the next day, she told me that she had
      been practicing her part of the poem on her own. She recited her two lines
      for me, and her dedication to the meaning behind the words and the pride
      that she took in the performance of it was just beautiful. I am so happy to
      share that she has decided that she will sing one of her songs in the perfor-
      mance. Just two months ago she was not willing to do so, and I am so glad that
      she changed her mind. This is a brave decision, and it will make a powerful
      addition to the show.



      Three W eeks to G o!
      24 July 2012

      We had another really productive rehearsal and managed to get through the first
      half of the performance, which includes all of the monologues, and everyone
      was pleased. I think it was good for us to have a more concrete sense of what the
      evening will actually look like.
          I’ve had a few one-on-ones with Barry to help him memorize his section
      of the group poem, as he has visual impairments and will not be able to
      read the words. During our meeting I gave him a direction that must have
      seemed detached from the rest of the poem. He thought for a minute, and then
      responded by saying, “Yes, but I’m part of a whole, right? I need to be aware of
      and respond to what the people around me are doing on their lines too.” We are
      each a part of a whole, here, and none of us could do this alone.
          We are all working really hard, and everyone is dedicated to the perfor-
      mance. Nora has a very quiet voice but is making a pointed effort to speak
      loudly. Even Barry commented on her improvement. Fay and Fiona are prac-
      tising a lot on their own. Tom has told his whole family about the performance,
      and it looks as though they will all be coming. Barry is also expecting a large
      crowd – he asked for twelve invitations (I was expecting to give everyone four
      or five!).
          Three weeks to go.

S hare the J oy
31 July 2012

This week we had our best rehearsal yet. And it was the first time I realized
that, with only two and a half weeks until the show, I am going to be so sad
when it is all over. I think a lot of people in the group will be, too. We’ve become
quite close.
    We read the play twice, and I couldn’t believe how well this went. Then, with
ten minutes left, we read through our group poem and, like the play reading,
it was fantastic. My only directions were, “Be energetic! Be loud! Listen to
everyone else when they speak!” The two people who had to memorize their
lines did so with no problems and picked up their cues without delay.
    My one-on-ones were so nice this week too. Fiona and Barry both told me
how much fun they are having, and how much they enjoy the group and our
one-on-one time together. Then, when I was meeting with Norman and told
him I had to go meet with Ned, he said, “Yes, go share the joy.”



S ix D ays Til S how time!
8 August 2012

We’re almost there! And we are ready.
     One thing I’m finding really interesting throughout this process is watching
the different ways the actors are working. Vocal technique comes really easily
to some people while others have to work especially hard to speak loudly and
clearly. The people who struggle more have been working incredibly hard, and
it’s amazing to see their effort and determination. I think it’s actually visible
in the work.
     What is also amazing is the support they all show for each other. Those who
haven’t been struggling as much keep mentioning with awe how much the
others are improving, and those who have been struggling often say how much
they admire the others’ work.
     After a read-through of the play, we talked about whether we want to have a
talkback at the end of the performance. I would like to have one, so the audience
can have a chance to speak directly to the group members about the process.
So far, any observations about the group have been filtered through my voice.
     One of the Recreation Therapists turned to the group and said, “Let me
give you an example of a question someone might ask: Have you been enjoying
the theatre group?” There was an instant response from the group. “Oh yeah!”
“Yes!” “Of course!” And then we asked everyone to be specific about what they
have enjoyed. People talked about meeting new people and becoming friends,
about trying something very different and challenging, and about hearing each
148   Aynsley Moorhouse


      other’s life stories. Then Norman turned to me and pointed. “We like her!” he
      said, with a big smile on his face.
           We then talked about the post-show reception and a few people voiced that
      they want to be able to invite friends and family. I completely agree: it would be
      really hard to kick everyone out right after the show. We were trying to cut down
      on costs, but it wouldn’t be worth it.
           The Recreation Therapist began asking questions because she is organizing
      the food. I said something dismissive like, “Oh, don’t worry! It will work out …
      we’ll just get a bit more.” Then I laughed because I realized how unhelpful
      that was. We were all laughing and Tom raised his hand and waved at me to
      come over with the microphone. He looked at the group and said, “The fairy
      godmother will bring the cookies!”
           After deciding to double our food order, we all said goodbye. One rehearsal
      left!



      I t ’s S how time!
      12 August 2012

      One more day! I can’t believe it.
          I have so many butterflies in my stomach about tomorrow and Tuesday, but
      I know it is going to be a beautiful show. I won’t leave many details of our last
      rehearsal here just now, because of course it went very well – and I need to get
      back to getting ready for the big show.



      W e D id I t !
      21 August 2012

      I am finding it difficult to put into words the full experience of what has
      happened over the last five months since the group has been meeting, and
      especially over the last few weeks leading up to the performance. It has been
      amazing. Terrifying. Exciting. Moving. Hilarious. Unnerving. Inspiring.
          At the beginning, many group members expressed doubts about the group
      itself, but they kept returning week after week and said they were intrigued
      and were having a great time. Almost everyone expressed concerns and doubts
      about our ability to create a finished product, even up to 3 weeks before the
      performance.
          I really can’t express how much the people in the group have changed and
      grown over the last five months. I took videos of almost all the rehearsals, so I
      have been able to roughly track the group’s progress and conduct a qualitative
      analysis of the effectiveness of the program. I also checked in with participants
                                                          “Hooray for You and Me”    149


throughout the process to find out how they felt about the whole thing. The
results have been astonishing. It is so neat to see nine people in their 80s and
90s excited.
    On the days of the performances, so much of what I saw and heard from the
group members was reminiscent of how I felt as an emerging young actress.
Being on stage is an intangible experience, and it’s why so many people get
drawn into the theatre, in spite of the poor odds of ever being able to live above
the poverty line and in spite of the constant struggle. The people in this group
got to experience this feeling for the very first time, so late in life.
    Close friendships and intimate bonds were the facets of theatre that I
loved the most as a young actress, and I saw them replicated here at Baycrest.
An invaluable outcome of this project has been the connections that were
built between group members, the larger Baycrest community, and, I think,
beyond. Before the show, the group members were all laughing and talking
together easily, and making jokes with each other. Many group members have
commented repeatedly on the friendships they have made in the group, with
people they had never even met before.
    Over the two performances we had between 150 and 200 audience members.
It was incredible – and the performers blew everyone away. One audience
member, also a Baycrest resident, approached one of the group members a
couple days after the show to say how much she loved the performance and
how moved she was by it. The actor invited her over to her room later that day
so they could talk about it.
    Another resident who declined joining the group told me, right after the
show, that when he first heard about it he thought it was going to be silly, and
he didn’t want to have anything to do with it. After watching the production, he
had to tell me how wrong he was, and how amazing it was to see these people
express and create with such dignity and power.
    On our first day back in March, as he was leaving, Barry had said to me,
“I am starting to get a glimmer of interest in the project. Just a glimmer.”
Then just yesterday he said with incredible emotion, “We were just a bunch of
ordinary people, there was nothing special or extraordinary about us. I mean,
we weren’t actors … And you took us … you got us all together and now look at
us!”
    Nadine has said to me a number of times that she would like to keep the
group going, because with her vision and hearing problems, engaging is diffi-
cult for her. She felt that this was a stimulating and fun experience, and really
hopes that it continues. Everyone is really sad that it is over, and they want to
keep meeting. I do too. Nora has said that she doesn’t know what she’s going to
do with her Wednesday afternoons. “They’re so boring now,” she says. Ned has
said the same thing. It was very hard to say goodbye.
    So for now, I will just say: Au Revoir!

Wakes, or at least thinks she wakes. Sniffs, expecting mahogany,
black earth, gets a whiff of lemon polish, an outhouse door left open.
On her back, arms at her sides, not wrapped around her husband –
where is he? Flexes fingers, toes, ankles, elbows – joints respond
the way they should do. Rubs one palm down her thigh, slick of a nylon
nightgown. Once, on her honeymoon, she slept in pink satin.

Opens her eyes. Gray square a window in the wrong place, wrong shape
to be her room at home. Too much stuff – wardrobe, armchair, bookshelf –
too many pictures on the walls, all white borders, black frames – oh, family
photos, her children and grandchildren. How can she be as old as her own
mother? Feels the weight of her infants in her arms.

Knock, knock – door opens before she can ask who’s there? Squeak of soles,
rough hands, a soft voice urging get up now, it’s time to get up. Sheet pulled off
and the stink of pee, a baby’s wet the bed. Can’t they hear the baby crying?

Half carried, half pulled into a bathroom. Light too bright, rods bracketing
the toilet. A sink. No tub, no shower. Shivers when the gown’s stripped off,
folds her arms across her single breast. The scar aches. Heart hammering.

Tugged and heaved and a diaper pulled up between her legs. Finally, allowed
to sink back into bed, though it’s too hard and barred just like a crib. Sheets
frosty cold and stiff, stink of a chemical that mimics drying on the line. She
always dried her sheets out on the line. Where is she now? A hospital? A prison?

Lies flat on her back, stares at shadows pulsing on the ceiling. A thread of light
under the door now shut. Straightens her legs, feet arched against the cramps.
Folds one hand on the other, palms flat against her chest, feels it rise and fall
with each sighed and stubborn breath. Eyes closed, counts sheep. Wills
her body to be still. To be prepared. Practicing for death.

to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

Amanda Ciafone


When the proprietor of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beau-
tiful, Sonny Kapoor, hyperbolizes his goal “to create a home for the elderly so
wonderful that they will simply refuse to die” immediately after the death of
one of his residents, he is a comical Third World tout selling his care home
through fantasy. But the fantasy of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (BEMH)
is more powerful, as the movie presents a vision of distributing the Global
North’s presumed burden of caring for older people to other parts of the world;
in the process, it reimagines those older people as being able to take care of
themselves. The radical difference of the Indian care home portrayed in the
film sets the stage for a comparative normalization of its elderly British protag-
onists and an opportunity for them to demonstrate characteristics most cele-
brated in contemporary societies and economies through their encounter with
otherness.
    These films are not alone in representing old age abroad; indeed, “old-age
migration” appears to be increasing, both in media representations and in actual
practice.1 With the popular press reporting on an impending demographic and
economic crisis in the developed world, as they often frame the increasing
population over the age of 65 and the strains on health care, social welfare,
and long-term care systems as well as national economies, there are increasing
mentions of older people moving abroad for old age and its associated care.

to BEMH and its sequel, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2ndBEMH), other texts
tell similar stories about the adaptability, resourcefulness, and vitality of older people
as they construct a Third Age through an encounter with difference in the Third World. On
the small screen, reality TV – including a BBC miniseries inspired by the films, The Real
Marigold Hotel (2016–present), and House Hunters International (2006–present) in
North America (internationally on the Travel Channel), – has presented such narratives.

      These decisions seem to be motivated by economic concerns–concerns that
      private and public pensions, national health-care plans and personal savings
      will be underfunded or insufficient to support an established standard of living
      or, at the least, a decent old age. Persistent inequality between regions of the
      world means that older people’s purses of pounds, euros, yen, won or dollars
      may feel strained in their home countries but have impressive purchasing power
      in developing economies. Communications and transportation technologies
      allow greater interconnection across distance, while the legacies of colonialism
      and contemporary transnational consumption (of international goods, tourism,
      etc.), discourses of global cosmopolitanism, and assumptions of the free flow
      across borders for the privileged empower Global North citizens to imagine an
      old age abroad.2 As a result, a significant number of people are moving from the
      Global North – thus becoming “old-age migrants” – to warmer, more affordable
      locations for retirement and care in old age (Ackers and Dwyer; Banks; Casa-
      do-Díaz et al.; Croucher; Gustafson; O’Reilly; Huber and O’Reilly; Warnes and
      Patterson; King et al.; O. Morales; Dixon et al.; Ibarra; Toyota and Xiang; Horn
      et al.; Horn and Schweppe).
          As aging studies scholars and critical gerontologists point out, in a time
      when Global North countries frame aging as a crisis, with concern about social
      security, health care, and long-term care systems collapsing under the weight
      of a large aging population, other social, cultural, and academic discourses
      have reconceived the non-frail old in an “active aging” paradigm, constituting
      them as the “new elderly” and the “young-old” in the “Third Age” and hailing
      them as active and productive contributors to society and economy (van Dyk,
      “Appraisal” 93). Active aging principles attempt to acknowledge and empower
      older people, but they also reproduce classist, racist, sexist, ableist, and even
      ageist assumptions in the definition of who and what is deemed appropriately
      “active.” Active aging logics also serve an ideological function in the context of
      neoliberalism, enabling the restructuring and retreat of the welfare state and
      the privatization and outsourcing of the maintenance of old age onto old people
      themselves, who are reimagined as resourceful, flexible, creative, and econom-
      ically generative in terms acceptable to contemporary capitalism (Cruikshank;
      Holstein and Minkler; Katz and Calasanti; Katz, “Growing”; Katz, “Busy”;
      Laliberte Rudman; Marshall; van Dyk, “Appraisal”).



      2 | This chapter focuses specifically on old-age migrants from developed countries who
      have had little previous interaction (touristic or brief) with the less-developed countries
      to which they are relocating. There are growing bodies of literature studying immigrants
      to developed countries returning to their countries of birth for old age as well as the
      transnational migration of older people to the Global North to serve as care providers
      themselves (for grandchildren, etc.).

    In this context, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and its sequel, The Second
Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, present fantasies of simultaneously outsourcing the
costs of economic, physical, and emotional care to other societies and, for older
people, outrunning the limitations of aging conceived in the Global North by
encountering difference in order to prove the older characters’ mobility, adapt-
ability, risk-taking behaviour, and entrepreneurial productivity, the very quali-
ties that define their neoliberal subjectivity and justify potential cuts to govern-
mental support. Texts like the BEMH films thus help construct a Third Age
through an encounter with difference in the Third World.



“O utsourcing old age . I t ’s a brilliant ide a .”
BEMH’s primarily North American and European audiences need little reason
to take seriously the prospect of British characters moving halfway around
the world to a care home in India, so accustomed is the audience to the many
arguments that Global North societies are facing a demographic “crisis” that
requires solutions both on the scale of the individual retiree and society more
broadly. Similarly, the idea that enterprising young businessman Sonny would
see these population shifts and the various societal failures to meet their chal-
lenges and attempt to capitalize on his country’s lower cost of living by creating
a care home to “outsource old age” to India seems to make good global capitalist
sense to viewers trained in accepting the worthiness of profit maximization.
Sonny markets not only the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel’s postcolonial afford-
ability but also its “proud tradition of the Raj,” in an orientalist appeal to white
Brits of a certain age. Therefore, within the first minutes of the film, each of
the British protagonists’ reasons for setting off have been presented in quick
succession, and they are arriving at the airport and embarking upon the fanta-
sies of their new lives in India.
    “Outsourcing” is the overarching conceit of BEMH, and the resulting chal-
lenges and possibilities of connecting across cultural difference are the main
drivers of character development and plot. In the very first moments of the film,
before we even see Evelyn (Judi Dench), we sense her frustrated disconnection
as she tries to make sense of her Internet connection and have a phone conver-
sation with a presumably outsourced Indian call-center worker who speaks
from a script rather than empathetically engage with her over the death of her
husband. Moments later, as the film introduces Muriel (Maggie Smith), it also
paints Global North social-welfare systems as overburdened and expensive,
and those not able to adapt to international capitalist fixes as antiquated and
racist. The British National Health Service offers Muriel a painful six-month
wait for costly hip surgery, or the alternative of becoming a medical tourist
“outsource[d] … to another hospital where they can perform the surgery almost
158   Amanda Ciafone


      immediately and at a fraction of the cost.” It is not, as xenophobic Muriel fears,
      “local.”
           But the clearest statement of the outsourcing fantasy of the film comes from
      the comical but loveable proprietor of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the
      Elderly and Beautiful, the young Sonny (Dev Patel), who states his business
      plan plainly, explaining to his mother how he will make his “fortune”: “I have a
      dream, Mummyji. A most brilliant one. To outsource old age. And it is not just
      for the British. There are many other countries where they don’t like old people
      too.” This is a moment of levity, but the piquant laughter comes from conveying
      a painful kernel of truth. By the film’s sequel, not only has the original film’s
      conceit been proven (extradiegetically) successful enough to financially justify
      the production of a second film, but also, within the world of the film, Sonny’s
      business plan has been vindicated, with both Indian and foreign investors
      interested in capitalizing on the transnational old-age market. As his rival
      Kushal (Shazad Latif) says of the need not only to continue but also to expand:
      “Outsourcing old age. It’s a brilliant idea. It’s brilliant and it’s working, but to
      keep growing, you’ve got to have somewhere to grow into.”
           2ndBEMH thus goes even further than BEMH, which portrays old-age
      migration to India as an economic solution for its older English characters
      to live well on meager retirement savings, by representing old-age migration
      to India as an economic solution for transnational capital as well. The sequel
      positions viewers not only to root for transnational capital as the future of the
      hotel but also to be in awe of it, as it displays an almost metaphysical power
      in the lives of the film’s characters. The film opens with scenes of Sonny,
      accompanied by assistant manager Muriel, selling their business plan to an
      American multinational senior-living corporation in an attempt to become
      its first Indian franchise and receive an infusion of foreign capital to support
      their proposed expansion. The film’s plot then revolves around unmasking the
      corporation’s secret reviewer, with the film asserting the imperative that he or
      she be impressed upon to recommend investment. This representative of US
      capital turns out to be Guy (Richard Gere), who finds not only a match for his
      corporation’s interests but also, in melodramatic style, a love match for himself
      in Sonny’s widowed mother. As the film closes, it is none other than the CEO
      of the multinational senior-living corporation (David Strathairn) who suddenly
      materializes as the audience contemplates Muriel’s foreshadowed impending
      death. With a calm, omniscient presence, he explains he is there “to pay [his]
      respects,” revealing he somehow knows she will soon die, as she questions him
      with both deep trepidation and deference, “What are you doing here? ... Why,
      why did you come here really?” He is a reassuring angel of death whose gaze
      lingers on Muriel as the scene cuts to the next morning when she, separate
      again from her English compatriots now each paired off in their romantic
      couples riding into the future, looks out onto her own fateful next moments.

The Third A ge in the Third W orld
Aging studies scholars, applying postcolonial studies approaches to aging,
have argued that in the developed world the elderly have been treated cultur-
ally, socially, and politically as “others,” even “subalterns” (Kunow; van Dyk,
“Othering”). As Kunow argues, old people have been “selectively identif[ied as]
a group of people whose age made them different from the rest of the popu-
lation and positioned them as an object of government policies” (104). While
public pension, health-care, and welfare systems cared for aged bodies and
protected older people from poverty, they also constructed old people as objects
of governance, acted upon but disempowered to act, thus subalterns removed
from social, cultural, and political participation. But in the recent decades of
neoliberal politics, the governance of old people itself has come under threat,
such that the “subalternity of senior citizens has by now become increasingly
precarious,” citing Estes and Phillipson: ‘If welfare and social security provi-
sion created […] a new identity for old age, it is precisely the transformation
of these institutions that has posed a major challenge to the position of old
people’” (281, qtd. in Kunow 104; ellipsis in original). Elderly populations are
perceived as a public burden, living longer, growing in demographic size, using
more public resources, and not contributing to the economic productivity of
the new economy, with neoliberal politics framing an intergenerational conflict
over resources, motivating proposed cuts to social-welfare systems. Further
enabling the reduced support and governance, older people are being culturally
reframed and remade as neoliberal agents rather than others.
    BEMH challenges the othering of old age by asserting the similarity of its
older protagonists with younger generations and the qualities of neoliberal
citizenship celebrated by contemporary societies and economies. As Madge
(Celia Imrie) humorously and didactically states, “I don’t want to grow older.
I don’t want to be condescended to. To become marginalized and ignored by
society. I don’t want to be the first person they let off the plane in a hostage
crisis.” BEMH does this normalization work by setting old age in comparison
to a people, culture, and locale represented as even more foreign and peripheral
to the experience of the assumed viewers – actual postcolonial subalternity –
thus making old age relatable and comparatively central or “normal.” Beyond
this comparative frame, the old people in BEMH shed their otherness through
their encounter with India and “the unsettling experience of exposure to other-
ness” (Gilroy 69). As life in India is presented as an “assault on the senses”
and a challenge for the characters to overcome, the older characters demon-
strate their potential personal development in later life, affirming the logic
of “active aging,” in this case by actively aging by engaging with difference.
BEMH thus assumes a white, Western, and multigenerational audience whose
ethnographic gaze is “fixed on the edge of a space looking in and/or down upon
160   Amanda Ciafone


      what is other” (Pratt 32), both Indians and old people, in the hopes that they
      can be impressed by both the radical difference of the Indian context to provide
      challenges for the older main characters and their ability to overcome those
      challenges by demonstrating characteristics generally associated with youth
      and the neoliberal economy, such as mobility, flexibility, resourcefulness, and
      risk-taking.
          In celebrating the assertion of the active aging paradigm that old age is best
      lived by facing new challenges the film validates the global mobility of the white
      British principals who move across borders to be empowered by the challenges
      they face in India. But this mobility is rooted in geopolitical privilege; even if
      they are economically strapped in the context of their British native home, they
      have the comparative cultural, financial, and racial capital to choose to migrate
      and succeed in reestablishing themselves in India. Karan Mahajan, one of the
      few Indian writers to review the first film, tersely entitled it “Eat Pray Die,”
      drawing attention to the orientalist, touristic pretense of the British charac-
      ters’ appropriation of India for their senior identity remaking and adventures.
      India is coded as an exotic, liminal contact zone where British protagonists can
      construct their identities in relation to the encounter with the other in a process
      that is mutual but dramatically imbalanced in power (Said; Pratt).
          Donning dupattas, riding in rickshaws, doing yoga at daybreak, the English
      characters demonstrate their adoption of Indian cultural life and their worthi-
      ness through adaptation, their ability to be flexible, mobile citizens with youthful
      openness to change and risk taking. BEMH celebrates the cultural adaptation
      of most of its main characters and denigrates those who resist embracing their
      Indian existence. Evelyn proves her independence after years of relying on her
      now-deceased husband, braving unknown streets and communicating across
      linguistic and cultural difference, even sparking a professional life for the first
      time by teaching a group of sales-focused call-center workers how to speak
      humanely to elderly British customers. Douglas (Bill Nighy) develops new
      interests in Indian history, exploring sites around the area, and demonstrates
      unknown resourcefulness in fixing up his broken-down Indian motorbike
      and hotel-room tap. Madge and Norman (Ronald Pickup) find a new terrain
      of Indian dignitaries and descendants of British colonial society to conquer
      sexually. And, most dramatically and pedagogically, Muriel is able to change
      from a virulent racist – fearful, resentful, and hateful toward the Indians around
      her − into a permanent resident who loves and is loved by her Indian caregivers
      and eventual co-workers. As Evelyn concludes in her voiceover reading of her
      blog, which narrates the first film and is itself a technological demonstration
      of her adaptability since at the start of the film she was not even clear about
      how to get online: “the person who risks nothing ... does nothing, has nothing.
      All we know about the future is that it will be different. But perhaps what we
      fear is that it will be the same. So we must celebrate the changes.” The social-
                                                      The Third Age in the Third World     161


climbing snob Jean (Penelope Wilton) becomes the closest to a villain in the
first film, shown to be frozen by concern about food safety, cruel to children
on the street in response to their persistent attention, and uninterested in the
history, culture, and people of India. Overwhelmed by “the climate, the squalor,
the poverty” – “this country’s driving me mad,” she explains – she holes herself
up in the hotel, before fleeing the country at her first opportunity (the film
makes her especially worthy of the audience’s disdain to excuse the budding
affair between her husband, Douglas, and Evelyn).
    Even as the films critique those characters who are unable to adapt to life
in India, their narrative centers are firmly English, repeatedly turning to the
difference between India and its people, who often serve as mere devices to
forward the development of the white characters into ideal active agers. As
reviewer Mahajan pointed out, when Evelyn teaches a group of “fawning call-
center workers how to speak politely to British customers,” or Muriel is the first
person to treat an untouchable sweeper woman humanely, “the film relies on
scenarios where foreigners get to civilize the willing natives in return for a little
emotional catharsis.” In the second film, some secondary Indian characters
are affirmatively othered as classically orientalist “noble savages” and “magical
negroes,”3 offering the British characters special insight into their personal
dilemmas. The representation of Evelyn’s uplift of her new business partner
Hari (Shubhrajyoti Barat) is merited by his almost prescient plan to use ageism
to negotiate a price with a textile producer and his simple intervention into
Evelyn’s dawdling at beginning a romance with Douglas. Gold-digger Madge’s
relationship with her driver (Rajesh Tailang) is straight out of a colonial melo-
drama; he is her quiet but faithful guide through both the streets of Jaipur and
her romantic life, deferentially calling her “my lady” as he chauffeurs her in
his vintage Ambassador. His pithy aphorisms, delivered with the understated
charm of a modern guru – “there is no present like the time” – win Madge’s
heart, although the film feels no need to suggest he was after it or that he would
do anything other than accept her advances. Wordlessly, Madge’s smile barely
intimates that she wants to sleep with him, and he, knowing as he is, needs no
further cue.
    The otherness of India – its risks and challenges – make it a foreign place
of possibility for the British characters’ plots and personal growth. The postco-
lonial threat of a speeding motorbike on the dark web of streets of old Jaipur
drives Douglas and Evelyn into their first physical embrace, facilitating new
amorous life in old age. Fear of having accidentally hired a hit on his girlfriend
from an eager Tuk-Tuk driver propels Norman’s plot through the second film,

3 | These films thus continue a long tradition in Western culture of characters of color
in stereotypical, supporting roles, defined as idealized others and portrayed as having
innate goodness, mystical insight or power put to the service of the white protagonists.

      lubricating even polyamorous life in old age. The successful adaptation of the
      protagonists to their postcolonial setting, their emotional vivaciousness (not to
      mention virility), and youthful risk taking is confirmed by having the second
      film conclude with each of the main characters riding through the Jaipur
      streets on Indian motorbikes, successfully paired off romantically, just like the
      young Indian couple of Sonny and Sunaina.
           The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful itself is the
      physical embodiment of Indian otherness that sets off the older characters’
      assertion of active aging and personal qualities generally celebrated among
      younger populations. A decaying building, unkempt rooms, pest infestations,
      barely functioning utilities, as well as the hotel’s ongoing construction – these
      all construct a setting of risk rather than safety and sterility, the typically touted
      attributes of care homes. The films mock such organizing logics of care homes:
      the English independent living community that Douglas and Jean consider at
      the beginning of the first film is represented as grim and lifeless and marketed
      by a patronizing salesman focused on the features that attempt to keep them
      safe as their bodies progressively age. The irony of that “beige bloody bungalow
      with a sodding panic button in the … sodding corner” is that it is only helpful
      if you happen to fall in that one location, Jean points out, a critique of care
      homes’ promotion of safety in an age of intrinsic risk. The hotel, in contrast, is
      full of challenges and risks: an unregulated space of slippery outdoor showers
      (Norman falls in one without injury), multiple stairways to balconies without
      handrails, and a kitchen that serves up Indian dishes that overwhelm British
      palates and digestive systems. The staffing by non-professionals, embodied by
      Sonny, who is not only unprepared for his residents but also comically lacking
      in a basic understanding of old age, results in frequent ridiculous intergen-
      erational behavior that not only provides moments in which ageism can be
      laughed at but also necessitates self-reliance on the part of the residents. India’s
      difference becomes the proving ground of the sameness of the older characters.



      E ntrepreneurial A ging
      The residents of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel prove themselves not only
      culturally adaptive and not risk-averse but also self-starting and entrepre-
      neurial in their new postcolonial context. By the second film, all of the English
      residents are gainfully employed in India. In fact, the move to the Indian care
      home seems to launch them into new careers and enterprises rather than
      enable rest and retirement. Douglas is a tour guide, creatively overcoming his
      memory loss through technology and a young Indian assistant who reads the
      script into his earpiece. Norman and Madge manage the bar at the Viceroy
      social club, hustling to keep it economically viable by watering down the wine.
                                                  The Third Age in the Third World   163


Presumably having left her call-center consulting gig, Evelyn has leveraged her
hobby of shopping for textiles into a position as a buyer for an import company.
And Muriel now manages the hotel with Sonny, serving not just as a figure of
sensible steadfastness to Sonny’s flights of fancy but also as the blunt, plucky
spokesperson for the hotel’s expansion that ultimately sells the plan to a US
corporate investor.
    This focus on work and enterprise demonstrates these characters’ worth
and merit through their performance of sameness with the middle aged who
are defined by their work lives, and negates potential difference as non-pro-
ductive elderly (van Dyk, “Othering” 2). Through their flexibility, mobility,
creativity, resourcefulness, and the construction of “entrepreneurial selves,”
these characters prove themselves worthy subjects of neoliberal capitalism
(van Dyk, “Othering” 3; Bröckling; Ouellette and Hay) and thus perhaps no
longer necessary objects of governmental support and social-welfare systems.
Contemporary popular culture and political discourse associate such qualities
with youth, who are seen as drivers of the new economy, whereas the elderly
are celebrated, in comparison and often patronizingly, for their wisdom, expe-
rience, courtesy, and loyalty, attributes deemed less attractive by neoliberal
societies (van Dyk, “Othering” 3). BEMH redeems the difference of its aged
characters by asserting their value similar to those most celebrated by the new
economy.
    This assertion was made explicit in the 2ndBEMH’s partnership with the
organization Senior Entrepreneurship Works. The film’s production company
co-sponsored a series of summits on “Senior & Multi-Generational Entrepre-
neurship” in a dozen world cities in 2015, which, in addition to discussions
on ways to “pivot corporate and government cultures, policies and legislation
to embrace and leverage the valuable expertise of the Experienced Economy
(50+ workers) in new business startups and multi-generational workforces,”
included pre-release screenings of the new film. The film’s closing credits end
with the statement, “At any age, life can be an adventure,” directing viewers to a
website with information on the film’s “alliance” with Senior Entrepreneurship
Works. In a direct statement of the link between the positive promotion of old
age and capitalist economics, the organization states on the site: “Changing
the negative paradigm of aging and amplifying the economic vitality of people
50 and older is not just a social issue; it’s an unprecedented global economic
opportunity,” shifting old people “from burden to benefit,” as the organization’s
home page continues (Participant Media; Global Institute for Experienced
Entrepreneurship). Old people are marketed to corporations and governments
through their positively valenced difference – their experience, their wisdom,
and their assumed dormant productivity in retirement – as well as the asser-
tion of their similarity to younger generations, by “unleashing the potential” of
entrepreneurship with experience in the Third Age, a combination the group
164   Amanda Ciafone


      awkwardly calls “experieneurship.” Such organizations mobilize the assump-
      tion of a demographic and economic crisis of a large aging population without
      guarantees of social-welfare commitments by the state or corporations. Rather
      than fighting for such support, they offer such neoliberal market solutions as
      empowering individualized risk taking and flexibilized self-exploitation in the
      discourse of active aging, framing their work as “creating systems to boost
      economic self-reliance, vitality and growth.”
          The representation of BEMH’s characters as the prototype of the neolib-
      eral free-agent aged romanticizes a global aging empowered by free flows of
      people across national borders, enterprisingly creating wealth for themselves
      in the service and cultural industries characteristic of the new economy.
      But India, like most Global South and Global North countries, has an immi-
      gration policy and visa process that restrict non-citizens’ employment. In
      reality, cross-border employment is complicated by national regulations and
      oversight, and is not one characterized by older people falling into or exper-
      imenting with new professions. BEMH’s retiree migrant characters may be
      working in informal arrangements, paid “under the table” without any official
      certification, parlaying their English-language skills and expatriate cultural
      capital into service and retail work for foreign consumers in the era of a global-
      ized, free-market India. The films emphasize the romantic dimensions of
      embarking on these endeavors but pay little attention to the precarity of the
      work: the lack of job security, poor and irregular pay, lack of benefits, and in
      many cases the illegality of these jobs for the types of visas these characters
      would actually be eligible for.
          The precarity of the employment with which retirement migrants finance
      their aging abroad, as well as their creativity in the face of economic pressures,
      is evidenced by the wealth of online writing about old-age migration itself.
      Much of it is produced by older people who moved abroad for their retirement
      and now fund themselves through freelance employment, advising others on
      how to “Retire Better – For Less – Overseas,” “Retire in Comfort with Panama’s
      Pensionado Visa” or “Fund Your New Life Overseas With These 6 Portable
      Careers” in subscription newsletters and magazines promoting retirement
      abroad such as International Living. (Not surprisingly, advertising-supported
      blogging about the locale, photography of local sites, English-language instruc-
      tion, opening a tourist B&B, and import-export endeavors are some of the
      proposed “portable careers.”) These old-age migrants supplement their own
      retirement finances with income generated from being local experts as anchor
      retirees in informal and often precarious cultural work that bolsters the trans-
      national retirement industry itself.

While in BEMH the residents are celebrated for their employment and produc-
tivity, in the development policies and discourses of Global South countries
trying to attract old-age migrants they are valued instead for their consumptive
power. At the time of the 2011 filming of BEMH, there were no Indian care
homes catering specifically to foreign nationals, as anthropologist of Indian
care homes Sarah Lamb notes (192), but the business model of “outsourcing
old age,” as Sonny proclaims it, is not merely speculative fiction, as many coun-
tries had already established policies to attract old-age migrants to profit from
the movement of older Global Northerners and their capital. Attracting senior
migrants by constructing “transnational corporate care markets” has become
a development strategy for several countries, although there has been scant
scholarly attention paid to it (Yeates, “Going Global” 1116; Toyota and Xiang).
Older migrants who can demonstrate stable incomes, savings accounts with
local banks, investment in real estate, or portable health insurance are seen
as sources of foreign reserves of dollars, pounds, and Euros and as consumers
who will stimulate economies with their purchasing and employment of local
medical, service, and eventually care providers. A nexus of state and industrial
forces work to target “quality” old-age migrants, as an official with Thailand’s
Long-Stay Tourism Management agency described those expected “to become
sustained high-power consumers in residence” (Toyota and Xiang 714).
     A number of states around the world have established policies to attract
retirees, encouraged by real estate, health care, and other service industries
hoping to profit from a potential “retirement tsunami” of old age migrants on
their shores, as the Philippine Retirement Authority celebrated it (Toyota and
Xiang 712), evocatively and ironically with reference to a destructive natural
disaster. In the Global North the term has frequently been deployed in phrases
such as “gray tsunami” and “silver tsunami” as a negative, alarmist metaphor
for an impending demographic “crisis” of aging populations (Charise 1–2). But
for Global South countries hoping to profit from old-age migration, the tsunami
is remade as a powerful resource, co-constructed by Northern societal percep-
tions and priorities. These countries have promoted themselves as old-age
havens for prospective waves of foreign nationals, billing themselves as warm
locales offering a low cost of living, long-term residency, retiree discounts, and
even tax protections. The Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Panama, Ecuador,
and Belize are exemplary, offering programs that compete with each other to
attract people of a certain age and income with benefits such as multiple-entry
visas to allow for long-term residency, tax-free pensions and annuities remitted
to the country, exemptions from customs duties on the importation of personal
effects and from taxes on the purchase of some goods, and generous discounts
on services like utility bills, public transportation, airline tickets, hospital

      bills, and closing costs for home loans. Panama, for example, combines a visa
      program with generous benefits and discounts on services to retirees, low tax
      rates, and incentives for real-estate investment, establishing what International
      Living named “the world’s best retirement incentive program.” It has become
      one of the fastest-growing destinations for international retirees, “reaching
      what one called a ‘frenzy’ in Panama” (“Panama Visa and Residency Informa-
      tion”; Dixon et al. 1). Similarly, the Philippines, whose nursing schools served
      as metaphorical “export processing zones,” producing large numbers of nurses
      and care workers who labor in care industries around the world, undertook a
      strategy of encouraging the retirement industry in the country to put that care
      labor to work locally. The Philippine Retirement Authority (PRA), together with
      the business association Philippine Retirement Inc., lobbied the government
      for favorable policies toward the retirement industry, including the recognition
      of retirement developments as literal Special Economic Zones, entitling them
      to income-tax deduction from 5 to 35 per cent (Toyota and Xiang 714; Philip-
      pine Retirement Authority). By early 2016, 42,511 foreigners were enrolled in
      the Philippine retirement plan, and the PRA aims to more than double that
      number to 100,000 by 2020 (N. Morales). The PRA estimated that the retire-
      ment industry, which it identifies as “housing, healthcare and lifestyle” busi-
      nesses, yielded revenue of US$ 2.4 billion in 2011 and was then expected to have
      doubled by 2016 (Toyota and Xiang 710).
          The decision to relocate in old age may be motivated by economic consider-
      ations, but the determination of location takes into account practical concerns
      of health care, safety, and quality and availability of services, as well as consid-
      erations of climate, geographic and cultural proximity and familiarity (often
      derived from histories of colonial and neocolonial power), language, foreign
      investment, even official foreign currencies, producing certain locales as
      appealingly foreign but familiar to old-age migrants (Dixon et al.; Warnes and
      Patterson). Many of the destinations for old-age migrants do not have a history
      of care homes, as older people have traditionally lived with younger family
      members or brought in domestic workers to provide assistance and care in their
      own homes. But multiple transnational economic, social, and cultural forces
      are driving demand. Younger generations have migrated to other national and
      international locales, some to work in care industries themselves, setting off
      a “global care chain” for dependent children and parents who have remained
      at home (Hochschild; Parreñas, Servants and Force; Yeates, Globalising). Their
      absence as caregivers is filled through the financial support they provide for
      parents to live in care homes. The concept and business model of the care home
      has also globalized, as Lamb argues, with owners modifying and adapting the
      form to appeal to different cultural and social settings, such that it is not simply
      a Western transplant but takes root in an altered form depending on local
      understanding of aging, care, and dependence. At the same time, Global North
                                                  The Third Age in the Third World   167


old-age migrants moving to warmer, more affordable locations are aging in
these new places and looking to move into care homes that fit their conception
of aging but now in a foreign place.
    Most of those moving abroad for retirement could be called “young-old,”
those who are deemed the most desirable age demographic by these old-age
migration programs. The Philippine Retirement Authority’s General Manager
Valentino Cabansag has described the agency’s strategy: “Right now, it’s the
ambulatory and fun-loving retirees that we are targeting” (N. Morales). But
with the large numbers of young-old expatriates living in these locales, even if
a large number of them return to their home countries, there will be significant
demand for care homes for the remaining foreign seniors, which hospital and
care-home developers are beginning to meet in some locations. In Mexico, for
example, Roberto Ibarra’s 2011 study noted that there were roughly 40,000 to
80,000 North American retirees in just the central Mexican communities of
Lake Chapala and San Miguel de Allende, resulting in “growing demand for
assisted-living facilities” in Mexico, especially around expatriate communities
(“Health Care in Mexico”). Care homes in Mexico cost half of what one would
pay in the United States, with a range of amenities, including 24/7 nursing
care, serviced by a more affordable workforce. Abbeyfield, an independent living
facility in the Lake Chapala area, offers one-bedroom casitas beside lap-pools
and lush gardens for a little more than $ 1,000 a month, including three home-
cooked meals a day, all utilities including TV and internet, and on-call 24-hour
emergency assistance; in contrast, independent living in the United States
costs an average of $ 2,500 a month (McCleery). Assisted-living and nursing
homes in Lake Chapala, like Lakeside Care, cost between $ 1,400 and $ 2,000
a month for full spectrum care (the only additional costs to the resident are for
medicine and doctor visits); in the United States, such a care home would be
$ 3,800 a month for assisted living to upwards of $ 7,000 at a nursing home.
In 2016 there are at least nine care homes in the Lake Chapala area, two in San
Miguel de Allende, and two in Puerto Vallarta catering to English-speaking
residents (Carrel). The English-language website of the Mexican Association
of Retirement Assistance (AMAR), which promotes the development of the
Mexican retirement migration industry and lobbies government for investment
in and rationalization of the sector, includes advertisements for a dozen more
care homes, ranging from independent living to Alzheimer’s/dementia care
facilities. Few data are available on how many foreign nationals live in care
homes in Mexico, but it is clear that the private health-care industry plans to
expand its reach to North Americans, building on growing medical tourism to
develop more assisted-living facilities, care homes, and in-home nursing-care
programs (Ibarra 98).
    Clearly, outsourcing old age is an economic strategy considered by both
people and states, the latter not just in the Global South but also in the Global
168   Amanda Ciafone


      North, as intimated by Muriel’s experience in BEMH. From the early 1990s
      there have been sustained calls to extend Medicare (the US national health
      insurance program for people over 65, as well as for younger people with
      disability status) to recipients residing outside the country. American retirees
      abroad have been backed by lobbying from corporate interests – including
      Mexican real estate developers and the private health-care industry dominated
      by large, US-based corporations – who see the migration of Medicare-eligible
      populations as “a globalization process that transforms Medicare trust funds,
      and indeed health, into mobile transnational capital,” encouraging the privat-
      ization and profitability of health-care systems abroad (Ibarra 104). In the
      United States, the proposal has been pitched to politicians as a strategy to cut
      costs for taxpayers, potentially reducing Medicare spending by 35 to 70 per cent
      by paying for cheaper medical services in locations like Mexico (Ibarra 97).
          In this emerging transnational care market, Global South care homes
      project themselves as alternatives responding to discontent with care homes
      in the North (Horn et al. 169, 172). Whereas care homes in the developed world
      are understood as relatively safe, sanitary, managed and regulated, they are also
      perceived as rule-bound, impersonal, routinized, and understaffed institutions
      (Baines and Daly; Banerjee and Armstrong; Daly et al.; Lopez; Commission on
      Dignity in Care). In contrast, there is little government regulation or quality
      oversight over care homes in most Global South locations, but they represent
      themselves as having a comparative care advantage attributed to economic
      and cultural conditions producing more affordable, plentiful, and intrinsically
      caring staff who offer more individualized and affectionate attention to resi-
      dents, even if that care is less trained, professional, and accountable. Marketing
      materials and press reporting often suggest that care and respect for the elderly
      are culturally essential – even natural – to populations in the Global South,
      offering oversimplified explanations of the prevalence of multigenerational
      households and relying heavily on stereotypes of eager and accommodating
      women of color as caregivers. Horn et al. quote the website of a Thai care home
      catering to German residents: “Frail, elderly people are held in high regard in
      Thai society and deserve respect and good affectionate care … As a result, people
      in Thailand are highly motivated to care for elderly people … One outstanding
      quality of the care provided by the Thai staff is the warm-hearted, tender
      way they deal with elderly, dependent people: they are physically close and
      respectful” (170). As Lamb points out, the assumption that “Asians” are more
      natural caregivers or have a culture of looking after the elderly is belied by the
      fact that most of the foreign residents in Thai, Philippine, and Malaysian care
      homes are Asian themselves, but from wealthier countries. Similar portrayals
      of Latin American caregivers and care homes abound. As the owner of Mexican
      Lakeside Care insists, “they have great respect for the elderly and they will go
      out of their way to help an elderly person,” with a resident affirming, “people
                                                   The Third Age in the Third World   169


here have compassion written into their DNA, they do it before they know it.
The caring is just like being in an extended family” (McCleery). This emphasis
on individualized care and essentialized cultural character over professional-
ization, regulation or oversight results in practices and popular representations
of care relationships as intimate (more hands-on), familial (framed as treating
people as members of their family), and informal (less skilled and routinized),
with both positive and negative repercussions for caregivers and care receivers
alike (Horn et al.). And, importantly, these attributes are framed in compar-
ison with Global North care systems in a globalized care market, as one expat
writing from Mexico affirms: “The warmth and level of genuine caring is
surprising to many foreigners who are accustomed to perfunctory treatment
dispensed within institutional settings” (Paxson).
    Muriel and Anokhi’s (Seema Azmi) relationship in BEMH characterizes
this logic. Anokhi’s care, dutiful and deferential in the face of Muriel’s disre-
gard and even hostility as she recuperates from hip surgery, is inscrutable in
orientalist fashion. The audience is forced to assume that she is an intrinsic
caregiver, while the film offers the reasoning that she is culturally naturalized
to service due to her lot in life as a Dalit, or “untouchable,” in the Indian caste
system. Anokhi invites Muriel to her family’s home, because she is “the only
one that acknowledges her,” regardless of evidence in the previous scenes to the
contrary. In the second film Anokhi plays little role in the plot; she has already
performed her larger narrative service of helping Muriel to become less racist
and is now relegated back to being virtually invisible, if not literally untouch-
able. But she is there, dotingly, in the film’s last scene as Muriel faces perhaps
the final moments of her life, representing the closest thing she has to family.
The BEMH films thus conclude their work of constructing a Third Age defined
by neoliberal mobility, adaptability, resourcefulness, and risk taking through
an encounter with the challenges and difference of the Third World. For when
these characters inevitably progress to the Fourth Age, these films tell us, they
will have people essentially qualified by their challenges and difference to care
for them at the end of life.

The Terror of Dementia in Ian McEwan’s Saturday

                            I fear being the elderly friend, a man of both refinement
                            and squeamishness, whose eyes showed animal panic
                            when the nurse in the residential home announced in
                            front of visitors that it was time to change his nappy. I fear
                            the nervous laugh I shall give when I don’t quite get an
                            allusion or have forgotten a shared memory, or a familiar
                            face, and then begin to mistrust much of what I think I
                            know, and finally mistrust all of it. I fear the catheter and
                            the stairlift, the oozing body and the wasting brain.

Ian McEwan’s Saturday (2005) is typically read as a novel about the everyday
fears and constant worries that entered many people’s lives in the aftermath
of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The burning plane that opens the
novel causes protagonist Henry Perowne to think of terrorism and to embody
the pervasive sense of insecurity in the post-9/11 era. This is captured in his
sense that “Now we breathe a different air” (32) and is emphasized throughout
the novel, where we follow the ever-present news reporting both from the big
anti-war demonstration that takes place on the day the novel is set, Saturday
15 February 2003, and from the story of the burning plane. This story turns
out to have nothing to do with terror, but it still manages to accomplish the
goal of modern terrorism: to spread feelings of fear, insecurity, and precarious-
ness through a perceived sense of risk of seemingly arbitrary acts of aggression
(Butler). In the novel, the big, abstract fear of terrorism is concretized when
Perowne and his family become the victims of another kind of terrorism –
domestic terror – when a thug, Baxter, with whom Perowne was involved in a
176   Peter Simonsen


      seemingly innocent car accident earlier in the day, forces his way into Perowne’s
      otherwise safe house and holds his family hostage, threatening to rape his
      daughter, Daisy, who is pregnant.
          This critical emphasis on violent terrorism, which indeed calls our attention
      to what takes up most narrative space in the novel, however, has obfuscated an
      equally important aspect of this rich and multifaceted work: the way in which it
      captures the growing fears and constant worries of many people about ending
      up in a nursing home as a dementia patient. Fear of dementia, most often a fear
      of the most common disease to cause dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, is the fear
      of ending up as “living dead” behind closed doors at the mercy of casual care-
      givers. As Megan-Jane Johnstone notes in her study of media representations
      of Alzheimer’s disease, it

      has been controversially portrayed as “the disease of the century” that is poised to
      have a near catastrophic impact on the world’s healthcare systems as its population
      ages. This representation has given rise to a profound terror of the disease and a range
      of individual and societal risks believed to be associated with it. This terror and related
      anxieties have been positioned as requiring a remedy. (xvii)

      As Johnstone continues, the remedy for this kind of “terror” is often and increas-
      ingly – and problematically, from both moral and basic humanistic perspec-
      tives – “pre-emptive and beneficent euthanasia” (xvii). Among the many
      problems involved with this growing public discourse in favour of euthanasia
      is the culturally constructed image it promotes of the Alzheimer’s patient as a
      non-human “other,” as just a vegetable being or empty shell, when in fact there
      is increasing awareness among dementia researchers and carers that dementia
      patients live lives worth protecting and worth caring about and for (Kitwood;
      Leibing and Cohn; Hughes).
          The risks of terrorism and dementia are curiously paralleled in Saturday. The
      novel offers, through an unobtrusive third-person narrator focalized entirely
      through Henry’s intensely self-conscious and self-reflective mind, a finely
      detailed and psychologically realistic and engaging investigation of popular
      feelings about these contemporary life risks and the ways in which people try
      to deal with them: by containing one risk within a nursing facility with all
      the semblance of a private home; by trying to exclude the other by turning
      private homes almost into fortresses. In both instances, the novel suggests,
      such safety measures don’t add up and people are intruded upon and made to
      feel unsafe and to vicariously experience victimhood: a terrorist forces his way
      into a private home and threatens a family; and in an eerily parallel manner,
      Henry feels obliged to visit his mother, Lily, who has Alzheimer’s disease, in
      her nursing home, which makes him feel like a potential Alzheimer’s victim
      himself. Both home visits/intrusions cause fear and anxiety and give those
                                                                      Who Cares?     177


involved – and the reader – a sense of the precariousness of contemporary life
even as the novel, by portraying only Henry’s mind, also offers glimpses into
and allows readers to imagine what life might feel like both for the terrorist and
for the dementia patient, who readers are made to realize represent much more
than their feared pathologies.



The N ursing H ome in the C ontemporary C ultural I maginary
The house of fiction has many shapes and rooms. Houses and homes carry
much metaphorical weight in fiction as symbolic of the state of mind of their
inhabitants, and as physical, material “sites” (Alworth) they also function to
shape and mould characters and plots. As geographer Yi-Fu Tuan points out
in Space and Place, “The built environment, like language, has the power to
define and refine sensibility. It can sharpen and enlarge consciousness” (107).
A growing number of Western literary fictions take place in and around nurs-
ing-home facilities, with the “home” playing a significant role in plot and char-
acter development as a shaper of consciousness. According to Tuan, “Unique
to human beings as primates is the sense of the home as a place where the
sick and the injured can recover under solicitous care” (137). In other words, to
reflect on nursing homes and other spaces of assisted living is in a profound
sense to reflect on what it means to be human and on what localities most
deeply shape our sensibilities and consciousness as humans.
    Authors and readers are attracted to this, for many, off-putting, both
intimate and claustrophobic setting for a number of other reasons as well, of
course. Among them, surely, is the basic fact that our societies are aging, and
more and more such nursing facilities are needed to take care of a growing
number of very old, frail, and dependent individuals, whose families have
increasingly left behind traditional nuclear family structures where the gener-
ations lived together and the women typically stayed at home and took care of
the children and the elderly. These demographic and family-related changes
are again complexly connected to the accelerating individualization and
consumer culture of free choice in the West, where we place great emphasis
on self-realization and less emphasis on being attached to groups founded in
solidarity and self-sacrifice. This goes a long way toward explaining the preva-
lent emotional coding of the nursing home in this fiction as a place of fear and
terror, where people fear not just the death that concludes any nursing-home
stay (you don’t move out once you’ve moved in) but also the increasing loss of
personal autonomy and dependency on the care of others on whom many lives
come to depend. Feelings of fear are eloquently articulated by Philip Larkin and
Julian Barnes in my epigraphs and are reproduced by historian of the nursing
home Megan Davies, as quoted by literary gerontologist Sara Jamieson in her
178   Peter Simonsen


      argument against such traditional understandings of the nursing home, when
      she argues that even though many nursing homes “may aspire to provide a
      ‘warm, home-like ambience,’ this inevitably conflicts with the reality of how
      life in residential care is shaped by ‘rules and routine imposed from above’” (8).
      Combined with these feelings is a prevalent ugly sense of bad conscience and
      guilt on behalf of the relatives, partners, or adult children, who put their loved
      ones into nursing homes in order to live their own lives.
           This fear of loss of control and self-determination in combination with
      guilt at not caring enough by one’s own or others’ judgement fuels many nurs-
      ing-home narratives, whose vision is often based on somewhat old-fashioned
      notions of such institutions, derived from Victorian poor houses, as quasi-
      prison facilities and has led writers to imagine various alternatives. A number
      of such fictions have reached large audiences both as novels and through film
      adaptations. Deborah Moggach’s These Foolish Things (adapted as The Best Exotic
      Marigold Hotel and its sequel) and Jonas Jonasson’s The Hundred-Year-Old
      Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared (also adapted as a film)
      are both about handling the fear of the nursing home through escaping the
      traditional institution. In Moggach, a key character, the aged widow Norman,
      keeps getting thrown out of standard nursing homes because he is filthy and
      a pervert, so he has to stay with his adult daughter, Pauline, and her Indian
      husband, Ravi Kapoor. Norman terrorizes the household and jeopardizes the
      marriage, so Ravi and a cousin come up with a plan: outsource British elder
      care to India, build nursing homes in the former colony where there is cheap
      labour, and move the elderly out of sight to enable their relatives to go on with
      their lives as they choose.
           The actual nursing home in These Foolish Things is hardly a nursing home
      per se but rather a kind of run-down Indian all-inclusive holiday resort where
      resourceful British old-age pensioners in the “Third Age” move for a number
      of reasons – none of them being because they can’t take care of themselves any
      longer (note the film title’s use of “hotel” as euphemism for nursing home). In
      Jonasson’s phenomenally popular “geezer lit” novel, the centenarian protago-
      nist Allan Karlsson escapes from a traditional nursing home and its regime,
      which is embodied in the Director, whose strict rules and regulations regarding
      hours, liquor intake, and smoking Allan will not submit to. Instead, he takes
      off on a fantastic trip around Sweden with a suitcase full of money, with crim-
      inals and police on his trail and a luxurious ending ahead of him, where he
      realizes that he was not, as he had thought, neutered and impotent but can in
      fact have sex with a Balinese beauty. Jonasson’s nursing home does not take up
      much narrative space but is a crucial engine for the plot and action as well as a
      telling sounding board that reveals the character of the protagonist as someone
      preferably on the move. Yet it reads almost like a parody of an old-fashioned
      panoptic “total institution” (Goffman), where the will and freedom of the
                                                                     Who Cares?     179


inhabitants are controlled and they experience degrading dehumanization as
they are forced to develop docile, obedient, and fearful “institutional selves”
(Gubrium and Holstein). The main character is a cartoon-like figure for the
new, active, mobile, and empowered generations of elderly individuals who take
matters into their own hands and aspire to deny the biology of aging through
continuous activity. A common aspect of these two novels is that their main
characters are not demented and do not really need the nursing home with its
offer of care and protection.
     This is not to say that all nursing-home fictions seem to misrepresent the
realities of the nursing home, either through rendering them exotic, as in
Moggach, or through painting a too stereotypically bleak and in many senses
outdated picture of the nursing home, as in Jonasson. A number of contempo-
rary Danish novels, for instance, depart from the otherwise dominant norm
in Danish fiction set in nursing homes that the place is dehumanizing and
informed by a reign of terror that denies individuality. Instead, some novels and
short fictions provide more nuanced and sometimes even hopeful representa-
tions of the care work carried out in and by these institutions, which enable
new forms of living for both the elderly and their adult children (Simonsen). As
Sara Jamieson and Patricia Life have more recently argued in almost parallel
readings of Alice Munro and other Canadian fictions, the nursing home in
“The Bear Came over the Mountain” also abandons the stereotypical Victorian
nursing-home/poor-house model and may provide much needed “shelter” from
the outside world. Documenting a tendency in recent Canadian fictions toward
“a more positive public perception of late-life housing” (243) where characters
nonetheless must still resist the otherwise oppressive regime of the institu-
tion, Life even suggests that “some forgetting” (255) associated with dementia
may be experienced as positive, to the extent that what is forgotten may be
related to traumatic experiences in the past, such as a husband’s adultery. The
nursing home can be, and is increasingly being, imagined as a place for living
and loving, to some extent, on one’s own conditions; a place where, as Life puts
it, characters “can find a safe haven and shake off the shackles of their former
lives” (244) even as they may experience various forms of dementia. Surely we
need such images and narratives (what Life calls “aging-as-opportunity narra-
tives,” 256) as our culture and societies age and our reality is transformed in
this image.



M c E wan ’s S aturday as N ursing -H ome N arr ative
McEwan’s Saturday can be read as a nursing-home narrative, the genre that
“presents fictional texts and films that are either set in nursing homes or deal
with the complex array of problems and feelings associated with moving oneself
180   Peter Simonsen


      or relatives into a caregiving institution” (Kriebernegg 190). Midway through
      the novel, Henry arrives at his mother’s nursing home:

      By the standards of old people’s homes, Suffolk Place is minute – three houses have
      been knocked through to make one, and an annexe has been added. Out front, privet
      hedges still mark the old garden boundaries and two laburnum trees survive. One of the
      three front gardens has been cemented over to make parking space for two cars. Two
      oversized dustbins behind a lattice fence are the only institutional clues. (158)

      Far from a big, dehumanizing institution, this nursing home exudes homeli-
      ness and familiarity, though the focus on waste and the fence set the tone for
      the scene. While the visit takes up little narrative space in the novel, this space
      importantly constitutes the dead centre of the text and features its protagonist
      away from his comfort zone and with his guard down. The visit, in fact, is
      crucial to understanding the novel in the sense that the nursing home at its
      heart possesses an eerie kind of agency with respect to the main plot and char-
      acterization. Far more than a mere background, the setting alerts readers to
      what the novel is ultimately and most centrally about: Henry Perowne’s own
      fear of death, change, and mutability, and his intense need, but ultimate failure,
      to be in full control as a self-determined, autonomous Cartesian Subject.
          Titled from the day on which its action unfolds – Saturday 15 February
      2003, which saw hundreds of thousands march against the allied interven-
      tion in Iraq – the novel provides a trenchant commentary on global politics in
      the twenty-first century while also alluding to such modernist forerunners as
      Joyce’s Ulysses and Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway, which also follow their protagonists
      during one day’s movements through a city. It also, centrally, flags the subject
      matter of time and the experience of being in time. Indeed, at the end of the
      novel and a hectic day on which a complex plot has been resolved in a very
      dramatic climax, an exhausted protagonist Henry reflects:

      He feels himself turning on a giant wheel, like the Eye on the south bank of the Thames,
      just about to arrive at the highest point – he’s poised on a hinge of perception, before
      the drop, and can see ahead calmly. Or it’s the eastward turn of the earth he imagines,
      delivering him towards the dawn at a stately thousand miles an hour. If he counts on
      sleep rather than the clock to divide the days, then this is still his Saturday, dropping
      far below him, as deep as a lifetime. And from here, from the top of his day, he can see
      far ahead, before the descent begins. Sunday doesn’t ring with the same promise and
      vigour as the day before. (272–73)

      McEwan here alludes to the traditional iconographic representation of the
      “stages of man’s life” in terms of a wheel as he masterfully uses both the
      London Eye and the spinning of the earth as micro-macro images (similarly
                                                                              Who Cares?      181


to the way in which he deals with two kinds of terror) to capture the sense of
time passing and life moving toward the end, which is what is on Henry’s mind
more than anything. He is indeed on top of everything: he has a great job as
neurosurgeon, a perfect marriage to a successful woman, Rosalind, with whom
he has great sex and two successful children (one a poet, Daisy, the other, Theo,
a musician), a big townhouse in the heart of Bloomsbury, and a Mercedes.
What more could he desire? Despite all this – or rather because of all that he
has – he fears the death and decline that he cannot control (“Sunday doesn’t
ring with the same promise and vigour as the day before” [273]). And, because
he is a control freak, this bothers him more than anything.
    A telling instance of Henry’s need to feel protected occurs on his way to
visit his mother when he sits in his car, exhausted, and takes a nap: “Without
looking, he finds the button that secures the car. The door locks are activated in
rapid sequence, little resonating clunks, four semiquavers that lull him further.
An ancient evolutionary dilemma: the need to sleep, the fear of being eaten.
Resolved at last, by central locking” (121). Readers may sense a mocking implicit
author setting Henry up for trouble for seeking this intense kind of protec-
tion, and indeed this passage refers back to a similar one involving locks earlier
in the novel. Henry’s townhouse, like his Mercedes, physically embodies and
illustrates his need for control, shelter, and protection from the outside world.
The outside is dangerous and hard to understand and intrudes upon him as he
awakens during the night, opens a window, sees a plane on fire on its way to
Heathrow, and instantly thinks terrorism. Having woken up, Henry goes to the
kitchen and has a chat with his son, and on his way back to bed he notes the
house’s doors. Interspersed with the description of the doors is a muted mental
note on aging as decline and physical space as a means of protection:

He feels feeble in his knees, in the quadriceps, as he goes up the stairs, making use
of the handrail. This is how it will be in his seventies. He crosses the hallway, soothed
by the cool touch of the smooth stone flags under his bare feet. On his way to the main
stairs, he pauses by the double front doors. They give straight on to the street that leads
into the square, and in his exhaustion they suddenly loom before him strangely with
their accretions – three stout Banham locks, two black iron bolts as old as the house,
two tempered steel security chains, a spyhole with a brass cover, the box of electronics
that works the Entryphone system, the red panic button, the alarm pad with its softly
gleaming digits. Such defences, such mundane embattlement: beware of the city’s
poor, the drug-addicted, the downright bad. (36–37)

As the novel progresses toward its climax, we see this elaborate defensive
system being broken as home intruders force Henry’s wife to let them in and
to recognize that it is not possible to protect oneself from “the downright bad.”
Yet it is Perowne’s thoughts of growing old and frail (“This is how it will be
182   Peter Simonsen


      in his seventies”) that frame this elaborate, almost heavy-handed description
      of the physical defence system. Henry seeks protection not just from outside
      intruders; he also dreams of protecting himself from the biological process of
      aging even as he knows – as a medical doctor and brain surgeon – that there is
      no way of keeping the body safe from those cellular processes of decline.
          This is most clear in Henry’s visit to his mother, who lives in a nursing home
      close to his childhood home. This visit leads to his feelings of fear of death in
      the novel’s central chapter. Henry aspires to a state of thoughtlessness that his
      Saturdays are meant to represent, yet this Saturday is different. Waking up, he
      saw the airplane on fire and immediately thought of terrorism and the attacks
      on the Twin Towers just eighteen months earlier. In addition to this reminder
      of his vulnerability, Henry has been involved in a minor car accident and barely
      escaped being beaten up. He made it away only because he used his skills as
      doctor to diagnose the thug, Baxter, with Huntington’s Disease and lied about
      possible new treatment methods, something that deflated a pent-up situation
      and allowed him to escape. Yet the fear of Baxter, along with the worries about
      the new world order, war, and terror, inform his otherwise tranquil Saturday.
      Driving away from a lost game of squash to visit his mother, he reflects on the
      “gently tilting negative pitch of his mood”:

      Saturdays he’s accustomed to being thoughtlessly content, and here he is for the
      second time this morning sifting the elements of a darker mood. What’s giving him the
      shivers? Not the lost game, or the scrape with Baxter, or even the broken night [when
      he awoke to see the plane on fire], though they all must have some effect. Perhaps
      it’s merely the prospect of the afternoon when he’ll head out towards the immensity of
      suburbs around Perivale. While there was a squash game posed between himself and
      this visit, he felt protected. Now there’s only the purchase of fish. His mother no longer
      possesses the faculties to anticipate his arrival, recognize him when he’s with her, or
      remember him after he’s left. An empty visit. She doesn’t expect him and she wouldn’t
      be disappointed if he failed to show up. It’s like taking flowers to a graveside – the true
      business is with the past. But she can raise a cup of tea to her mouth, and though she
      can’t put a name to his face, or conjure any association, she’s content with him sitting
      there, listening to her ramble. She’s content with anyone. He hates going to see her, he
      despises himself if he stays away too long. (124–25)

      In this crucial passage right in the middle of the novel, the ambivalent feelings
      of relatives toward nursing-home inhabitants are revealed as the son is torn
      between different emotions about his mother, and the narrator reveals how
      much emotional intensity is involved in his relationship with her. Laid bare in
      this passage are Henry’s immense selfishness and need to feel protected: the
      emptiness of the visit concerns him, and he seems to feel sorry for himself both
      when he goes to see her and when he doesn’t.
                                                                             Who Cares?      183


    At the rhetorical level, we note that the same adjective is used to capture
his sense of a perfect Saturday and the mother’s feeling when someone sits
with her: “content.” To be content for Henry is to be “thoughtless”: not to be
self-aware, reflective, self-conscious. This state of being is coded positive as far
as Henry is concerned, close to bliss and the state of being happy, yet McEwan
subtly links that sense of thoughtlessness with his mother, whose “thoughtless-
ness” Henry fears more than anything (more than terrorism, losing at sports or
being beaten up by Baxter). Yet Henry knows what he has and would not know
he had lost it if he were in his mother’s shoes. He cherishes his life too much
not to be terrified when he finally sees her. Driving toward her nursing home,
he “finds he’s feeling better about seeing his mother”:

He knows the routine well enough. Once they’re established together, face to face, with
their cups of dark brown tea, the tragedy of her situation will be obscured behind the
banality of detail, of managing the suffocating minutes, of inattentive listening. Being
with her isn’t so difficult. The hard part is when he comes away, before this visit merges
in memory with all the rest, when the woman she once was haunts him as he stands by
the front door and leans down to kiss her goodbye. That’s when he feels he’s betraying
her, leaving her behind in her shrunken life, sneaking away to the riches, the secret
hoard of his own existence. (152–53)

It seems only natural that Henry should interpret his mother’s situation as a
“tragedy,” given everything she has lost (which she doesn’t know anymore). Yet,
and despite the fact that a son will find his mother’s failure to recognize him as
her son hard to bear (which is what takes place during all these visits when she
confuses him with an aunt), his interpretation that her situation is a “tragedy”
is subtly put into doubt by the narrator.
    This happens when the narrator begins to open up for a reading of the
mother’s state of mind and being that Henry hardly acknowledges but that
McEwan’s imagination dares to probe, as he suggests that maybe elderly people
with dementia are indeed happy. Upon first seeing her, readers learn that it
is hard to tell if she is “actually happy. Sometimes she laughs, at others she
describes shadowy disputes and grievances, and her voice becomes indig-
nant” (165). Knowing how to care for her, Henry steers her away from agitated
subjects and prods her: “If she becomes too agitated by the story she’s telling,
Henry will cut in and laugh and say, ‘Mum, that’s really very funny!’ Being
suggestible, she’ll laugh too and her mood will shift, and the story she tells him
will be happier” (165). As they prepare to leave and walk together through the
nursing home, they meet another inhabitant, Cyril: “He’s the home’s resident
gent, sweet-mannered, marooned in one particular, well-defined fantasy: he
believes he owns a large estate and is obliged to go around visiting his tenants
and be scrupulously polite. Perowne has never seen him unhappy” (166). And
184   Peter Simonsen


      finally, as they are about to split up: “Lily is happier now, and leans her head
      against his arm. As they come into the hall they see Jenny Lavin by the door,
      already raising her hand to the high double security lock and smiling in their
      direction. Just then his mother pats his hand with a feathery touch and says,
      ‘Out here it only looks like a garden, Aunty, but it’s the countryside really and
      you can go for miles’” (167).
          On the one hand, the text suggests that the elderly nursing-home inhabi-
      tants with dementia are happy, or at least capable of experiencing happiness,
      and that they don’t inhabit a “tragedy”; the true tragedy is felt by the relatives,
      in this fiction at least. On the other hand, they hardly have a clear idea of who
      they are and where they are. Cyril inhabits a fantasy, and Lily thinks Henry is
      her aunt and that she is outdoors. So does it make sense to think of them as
      happy? Indeed, the impression we get of the nursing-home inhabitants is in
      an eerie sense that of a perpetual bliss of forgetfulness and a lack of self-con-
      sciousness, in contrast to Henry’s (tragic?) anxiety that “in thirty-five years or
      less it could be him, stripped of everything he does and owns, a shriveled figure
      meandering in front of Theo or Daisy [his children], while they wait to leave
      and return to a life of which he’ll have no comprehension” (165). Henry fears
      his mother’s fate, which he sums up as “[m]ental death” (165), becoming a ghost
      that haunts his relatives, more than anything: “He isn’t ready to die, and nor
      is he ready to half die” (165). So he seeks to control his life and master the risk
      of dementia through diet and exercise: “No cheese then. He’ll be ruthless with
      himself in his pursuit of boundless health to avoid his mother’s fate. Mental
      death” (165). Yet prolonging life only increases the risk, and again: if these
      elderly individuals are happy, why fear their condition so much?
          There is nothing scary or dehumanizing about the specific nursing home,
      whose staff is described sympathetically as attentive and as striking a familiar
      mode of interaction with Henry. Arriving for his visit, Henry is met by one of
      the caregivers, Jenny, who opens the door as usual: “‘She’s waiting for you,’
      Jenny says. They both know this is a neurological impossibility. Even boredom
      is beyond his mother’s reach” (159). As a matter of fact, Henry knows the
      facts of the disease. His mother’s Alzheimer’s is slowly causing her cognitive
      decline: “The disease proceeds by tiny unnoticed strokes in small blood vessels
      in the brain. Cumulatively, the infarcts cause cognitive decline by disrupting
      the neural nets. She unravels in little steps” (162). Indeed, Henry’s unease and
      anxiety are linked to his superior knowledge of the disease and the brain and
      the fact that, despite his talent and almost godlike sense of himself as a neuro-
      surgeon, there is nothing he can do to alter his mother’s situation and almost
      nothing he can do to minimize his own risk of ending up in her shoes. No
      matter how many locks and security systems he surrounds himself with, they
      will not keep him safe from this condition.

    The nursing-home visit can enable readers to understand the novel as
contributing centrally to the cultural work of reimagining the nursing home as
a place of continued living and even loving and happy forgetting. As mentioned
above, Saturday has not yet been discussed as a nursing-home novel but rather
as a post-9/11 novel. Dominic Head discusses it in connection with terrorism
in his 2008 book on “the state of the novel” today, and similarly, in his 2013
study of twenty-first-century fiction, Peter Boxall considers the novel in terms
of terrorism and radicalism rather than with “the disease of the century” at its
heart. Most critics who focus on terror (and many who don’t) have explored
how McEwan negotiates an ethics of literature responding to the threat of
terror in his novel, which has many intertextual references and metafictional
elements. Henry, for instance, finds that he came to understand and appreciate
his mother’s intelligence only after she had lost it to dementia and from reading
Jane Austen and George Eliot (prompted by his poet daughter). Reading fiction,
he understood that “there was nothing small-minded about her interests” (156),
which she revealed during gossip. This gossip was centrally about illnesses and
operations and infidelities and the difficulties of telling good from bad people:

Jane Austen and George Eliot shared them too. Lilian Perowne wasn’t stupid or trivial, her
life wasn’t unfortunate, and he had no business as a young man being condescending
towards her. But it’s too late for apologies now. Unlike in Daisy’s novels, moments of
precise reckonings are rare in real life … (156)

The question is this: if Henry learned from others’ realistic fiction that his own
mother was more than “just” his “small-minded” mother playing the role of the
dutiful, self-sacrificing, stay-at-home housewife, that she was in fact a person
with substantial inner life, thoughts, values and worth, what can we learn from
reading Ian McEwan?
     One perfectly timed reckoning and effective reading lesson comes when
Henry’s daughter Daisy performs Matthew Arnold’s “Dover Beach” during the
hostage situation, which has a transformative effect on Baxter and saves the day.
Hearing the poem read out loud, believing Daisy had written it, Baxter reacts:
“It’s beautiful. You know that, don’t you. It’s beautiful. And you wrote it,” and
he goes on: “It makes me think about where I grew up” (222). An instance of
instant bibliotherapy disarms the criminal, shows him as a person with a rich
inner life, and puts him into contact with his feelings and childhood memories.
This controversial episode in the novel exemplifies the potential humanizing
and sensitizing good that literature might do in an otherwise hostile world (the
poem is even reproduced at the end as an appendix, perhaps with the hope that
the novel will make a similar difference): “Baxter fell for the magic, he was
transfixed by it, and he was reminded how much he wanted to live” (278).

          Yet even though the ethical dimension of this novel is the most critically
      examined and controversial element (see Winterhalter for an overview), no
      one has discussed what seems to be the limit of empathy for Henry: his own
      mother, into whose shoes he dare not imagine himself yet into whose shoes
      the text seems to suggest we should try to imagine ourselves, if only to accept
      the fact that we are at much greater risk of getting Alzheimer’s disease than of
      being killed in terrorist attacks. So even if the novel lends itself quite easily to
      being read as a commentary on life in what Ulrich Beck calls “the risk society”
      (qtd. in Jurecic, who – extraordinarily in a book on illness narratives – neglects
      to consider the illness at the centre of this novel in the context of “risk narra-
      tives”), it also, and just as easily, lends itself to being read as a commentary
      on life in what Arthur Frank in The Wounded Storyteller calls “the remission
      society”: the society where we have to learn to live with the knowledge that we
      are all, or will sooner or later be, in remission from one disease or another,
      that due to modern medicine and health systems we might be kept “well” for a
      long period of time, but not “cured” (8). Though we feel at risk from terrorism
      and sudden death (even if the statistics suggest we are not), we are also (and
      statistically much more so) at risk from diseases (including Alzheimer’s), from
      which we can’t be cured, but which can be treated, enabling us to live longer
      and longer in the remission society. Indeed, the two kinds of risk run parallel
      in this novel, whose main point is to familiarize its reader – through its protag-
      onist’s stream of consciousness – with those new, troubling types of risk we are
      facing today: terrorism and Alzheimer’s disease.
          Inadvertently making the reader associate Alzheimer’s disease contained
      in a feared site, the nursing home, with contentment and happiness can be
      understood as this novel’s way of “familiarizing” us with the risk of the disease
      and perhaps decreasing our fear of the nursing home. Indeed, the seemingly
      unselfconscious, wobbly mode of being-in-the-present the novel ascribes to Lily
      is so very close to the sense of being and state of mind that Henry Perowne
      himself cherishes, pursues, and experiences when performing open brain
      surgery on Baxter, whom Henry and Theo pushed down some stairs, causing
      him to suffer a massive head injury when the hostage situation was resolved.
      Henry now saves Baxter’s life on the operating table even as he simultaneously
      consignes him to a slow and painful death from Huntington’s disease. McEwan
      masterfully describes over several pages how the surgeon and the artist merge
      when he has Henry listen to Bach’s Goldberg Variations while beginning the
      operation:

      The tender, wistful Aria begins to unfold and spread, hesitantly at first, and makes the
      theatre seem even more spacious. At the very first stroke of sunflower yellow on pale
      skin, a familiar contentedness settles on Henry; it’s the pleasure of knowing precisely
                                                                             Who Cares?      187


what he’s doing, of seeing the instruments arrayed on the trolley, of being with his firm
in the muffled quiet of the theatre. (250)

We recognize the feeling of contentedness from earlier in the novel, where both
Henry’s usual mood on a Saturday and his mother’s new state of mind are
described. Now Henry re-enters that state of mind as he performs his “art of
neurosurgery” (255), which he knows is limited but which, he has no doubt, will
contribute to our coming to understand how the brain works. As he reflects,
very little is known about “how this well-protected one kilogram or so of cells
actually encodes information, how it holds experiences, memories, dreams
and intentions” (254), all the stuff that make up “this bright inward cinema of
thought, of sight and sound and touch bound into a vivid illusion of an instan-
taneous present, with a self, another brightly wrought illusion, hovering like a
ghost at its centre” (254–55). At some point, Henry feels certain, we will know
and maybe be able to prevent or cure diseases such as Huntington’s or Alzhei-
mer’s, yet at the moment, “faced with these unknown codes, this dense and
brilliant circuitry, he and his colleagues offer only brilliant plumbing” (255).
    Having performed the operation successfully, Henry writes up his notes
and the narrator sums up and connects Henry’s state of mind to the happy
elderly people’s states of mind in the nursing home earlier:

For the past two hours, he’s been in a dream of absorption that has dissolved all sense
of time, and all awareness of the other parts of his life. Even his awareness of his own
existence has vanished. He’s been delivered into a pure present, free of the weight of
the past or any anxieties about the future. In retrospect, though never at the time, it
feels like profound happiness. It’s a little like sex, in that he feels himself in another
medium, but it’s less obviously pleasurable, and clearly not sensual. This state of mind
brings a contentment he never finds with any passive form of entertainment … It’s a
feeling of clarified emptiness, of deep, muted joy. Back at work, and lovemaking and
Theo’s music aside, he’s happier than at any other point of his day off, his valuable
Saturday. There must, he concludes as he stands to leave the theatre, be something
wrong with him. (258)

As I have suggested, if there is something “wrong” with Henry – and with
the many readers who may identify with and envy Henry his perhaps too
perfect life, family, skills, accomplishments, and possessions, as well as his
smug manner of celebrating himself and what he has accomplished – it may
be related to his anxieties about physical and mental decay and to his inability
to feel and comprehend this as part of his life rather than as alien forces that
threaten and oppose it.

      C onclusion
      Why read nursing-home fiction? One answer is that it provides a space in which
      we can imagine ourselves in situations that, due to demographic changes and
      the aging of societies, we must increasingly become used to. These imagin-
      ings and re-imaginings of aging are necessary, on the one hand, because our
      elderly grow older and many into deep frailty and dependence where they do
      not necessarily suffer from having to move into a nursing-home facility, and,
      on the other hand, because if we don’t consider residential care for our frail
      and dependent elderly, we run the risk of abandoning decades of women’s work
      for independence from various unpaid family roles and burdens. To have one’s
      elderly mother put into a residential home is not necessarily to signal that one
      does not care for her; it is in fact to make sure that someone does care for her,
      ideally under proper working conditions and not at the cost of an experienced
      loss of autonomy on the caregiver’s side. Although he gives a good sense of the
      special ambience of the nursing home on a few pages, McEwan is not offering
      an institutional critique or evaluation. Rather, his interest is to explore what the
      place does to his protagonist’s state of mind and to show that Henry’s under-
      standing of the nursing home may not be adequate compared to how its inhab-
      itants experience it, given their radically other state of mind to which Henry –
      and Henry’s reader – despite his and our skill in “mind reading” (Zunshine), do
      not have access but which we sense is there and in need of care.
          Saturday can be read as a story about letting go of this fear through embrac-
      ing dementia as another state of being that – at least, and this is an import-
      ant caveat, at least for a short while – is in other contexts associated with the
      richest “moments of being.” Virginia Woolf thought of such moments of flow,
      where people transcend time, place, and self to experience genuine happiness.
      In the novel, this takes the form of what Henry thinks of as a kind of uncon-
      scious oblivion in a “biological hyperspace” (51), which informs the opening
      and closing scenes of the novel and frames the intense exploration of how one
      mind works its way through a day of extraordinary events, thoughts, and feel-
      ings. Just as Henry only learned to read his mother’s mind after she got demen-
      tia by reading Jane Austen and George Eliot, who could show him what really
      passes through such a woman’s mind, so do I suggest that we might learn to
      read Henry’s mother’s mind through reading his fearful failure to do so in
      this novel. And this reading lesson might make us better qualified to answer
      my title’s question of who cares for some of our society’s most precarious and
      vulnerable subjects.

Outside the Nursing-Home Narrative
Race and Gender Exclusions in Green Grass, Running Water

Patricia Life


Canada has an impressive literary tradition of works set in nursing homes.
Key texts (Traill, Wilson, Laurence, Shields, Wright, Barfoot, Munro, Tostevin,
Gruen, Hepburn, King) taken from the last century of Canadian English-lan-
guage publishing, when considered together, illustrate patterns in age-related
beliefs and behaviours in Canada and in nursing-home-narrative fiction. The
texts include Gothic stories of fear of the nursing home, of aging, and of death;
darkly humorous stories featuring empowered residents successfully living
within care homes; and fantastical stories of escape from the home and of
return to youthful behaviours and preferable habitats (see Life).
    This article does not assess the texts included in this literary collection but
instead considers what types of texts are absent from literary stories about
nursing homes and what types of people are missing from the rosters of
nursing homes and other care facilities and services. People such as the four
old Indigenous patients depicted in Thomas King’s 1993 novel Green Grass,
Running Water are excluded, feel excluded, and/or exclude themselves from
residency in Canadian institutions.
    Canada’s Multiculturalism Policy was established in 1971 and (according
to the current Government of Canada website) purports that “all citizens are
equal” and “can keep their identities, can take pride in their ancestry and have
a sense of belonging” (Government of Canada, “Canadian Multiculturalism”).
However, King’s text suggests that the needs of marginalized groups cannot
be met by institutions and services that historically have been geared toward
mainstream, dominantly white, and Judeo-Christian people.
    Green Grass, Running Water is an important work of its time for the message
it relays regarding Indigenous placement within white institutions and also
for its rallying message to the Indigenous community. King’s work, alongside
that of other artists, has helped to draw attention from both Indigenous and
192   Patricia Life


      non-Indigenous readers to the critical issues facing Indigenous peoples.1 The
      text offers readers an opportunity to imagine the feelings and the frustrations
      of living as an Indigenous person in Canada. King contrasts cultural attitudes,
      particularly in regard to race, religion, gender, aging, and care.
           At the end of the decade in which King published Green Grass, Running
      Water, the Canadian government finally closed the last of the residential schools
      that had been established in the 1800s in order to assimilate Indigenous
      children into the new Euro-Canadian culture. Although King does not speak
      openly about the ongoing disagreement between the Indigenous peoples and
      the Canadian government regarding the schooling of Indigenous children, his
      text contributed to the political pressure that eventually resulted in the 2007
      Indian Residential School Agreement, the 2012 report by the Truth and Recon-
      ciliation Commission of Canada entitled They Came for the Children (Govern-
      ment of Canada, They Came 1), and the 2008 formal public apology by Prime
      Minister Stephen Harper (Miller 2).
           The forced residential education endured by a century of Indigenous youth
      and the consequent injury to Indigenous communities were front-page and
      festering issues in Canadian society at the time King wrote the text. Green Grass’s
      story about the institutionalization of four elders continues to be relevant today
      because many elders are experiencing pain and disconnection when dealing
      with the non-Indigenous administration of their late-life care that are similar
      to what was experienced by the residential-school children of their own and
      previous generations.
           Centralized data on the state of late-life care of Indigenous people in
      Canada is difficult to obtain because the provinces administer health care
      while the federal government administers Indigenous matters (Beatty and
      Berdahl 7). In a 2011 article, Bonita Beulah Beatty and Loleen Berdahl, whose
      work focuses on the western provinces, express concern that large numbers
      of Indigenous seniors are being forced to leave rural and northern commu-
      nities in order to access health-care facilities and services where they are
      “essentially divorced from familiar contacts with family and community health
      systems” (2). Reports from care services on the Atlantic side of Canada are
      similarly negative. The 2010 publication of the Aboriginal Home Care Steering
      Committee of Nova Scotia introduces the findings of their Home Care on-Re-
      serves Project by reporting that an “overwhelming message coming from the
      communities is that long-term care is something culturally not accepted and
      something [Aboriginal people] try to avoid” (5). The steering committee adds
      that most respondents felt that existing services could never be adapted to meet
      Aboriginal needs.

     Green Grass, Running Water portrays a community’s efforts to preserve
and yet adapt its Indigenous lifestyle in a world dominated by non-Indigenous
people, and it presents the relative challenges of living on and off the reserve.
At the beginning of the novel, four elderly men escape from the mental institu-
tion that supposedly has been caring for them but that also has been isolating
them from their own land and people. The novel suggests that while white
culture sees four useless old men with dementia, Indigenous culture sees wise
and capable old leaders who have the ability to transcend earth’s limitations
with their supernatural powers and provide leadership to their people. They
leave the institution in order to resume their place as elders in the Indigenous
community and “fix the world” (123). By allowing readers to see into the inte-
grated and complex community of the Indigenous people in the story and to
witness the respect afforded the four seniors, the novel suggests that white and
Indigenous cultural differences are too great to expect or allow Indigenous
elders to be cared for by white administrations. By extension, the novel suggests
that white culture does not have the understanding or capacity to govern the
Indigenous at all. When King’s characters walk away from a hospital where
the administrator has either cared for them or imprisoned them, depending
on whom one asks, they are escaping not just from an institution but from the
dominant Judeo-Christian culture that they believe is responsible for breaking
their world (2).
     The nursing-home-narrative genre in Canada tells stories about white
straight people of Judeo-Christian and Anglo-Saxon descent living in nursing
homes that they may or may not be willing to call home. King’s text considers
the people who have excluded themselves, have been excluded, or who have felt
excluded from living in white institutional care, either because their ideology
precludes residency or because they are deemed unentitled by typical care-fa-
cility cultures. King’s endowing of the four protagonists with otherworldly
attributes, his use of myths taken from Indigenous culture, multiple narrative
voices, and postmodern reflexivity combine to create a fantastical, entertaining,
yet thought-provoking text with both magic realist and oral narrative character-
istics. However, race, and in particular Indigeneity, is his primary focus. King
makes fun of all of his characters, including the Indigenous ones, but he sends
cutting verbal barbs toward Western culture and its history of persecution of
Indigenous peoples.
     Through its escape narrative, the novel changes the four protagonists’ roles
from passive to active, metaphorically suggesting the wrongful imprisonment
of Indigenous peoples in places like reserves, white misunderstanding of Indig-
enous knowledge, and the challenges Indigenous peoples have in attempting
to remain true to their own identity while caged within a world run by white
cultures and governments. Although the four seniors are at the centre of the
plot, there are numerous story threads dealing with other characters. The entire
194   Patricia Life


      community of mythical and realist characters representing Indigenous peoples
      together acts as protagonist in conflict with white people and their culture.
      King’s title references the US government’s promise to respect Indigenous
      peoples’ rights to their land “as long as the grass is green and the water runs.”
      Bernholz et al. state that the source of this phrase is Article 5 of the Treaty with
      the Comanches and Other Tribes and Bands, dated 12 August 1861, which states
      that “[e]ach tribe or band shall have the right to possess, occupy, and use the
      reserve allotted to it, as long as grass shall grow and water run, and the reserves
      shall be their own property like their horses and cattle” (1). Patricia Linton has
      aptly explained that the “title of the novel is itself a metonymic allusion to the
      bad faith that separates Native and European Americans. It is a coded reminder
      of a history of appropriation and the instability of European intentions” (217).
      King tells an amusing story about four Indigenous elders who escape from
      a white institution and return home to their land, to their rightful position,
      and to the embrace of their own community, but he also writes of a dark truth
      and the deeply felt desire of real-world Indigenous peoples to hold members of
      white culture to their promises.
          Linton argues that the novel requires that “the truly competent reader is
      a member of a narrow group who, like the narrator, has insider-status in two
      cultural realms” (214). The non-Indigenous reader can appreciate many aspects
      of the text, but King makes exclusion clear by such techniques as the inser-
      tion of chapter headings in Cherokee2 with no translation readily available.3
      The text’s intriguing complexity has prompted a flurry of illuminating critical
      interpretations.
          The plot of the novel is, to say the least, complex. As Greg Bechtel writes,
      there are “two distinct narrative streams within the text: a realistic, linear story
      of contemporary Blackfoot characters in an identifiably real-world setting, and
      a series of four Native myths that initially appear unconnected to the realm of
      the everyday” (1). The four old men participate in both narrative streams, thus
      connecting all the stories and indicating a comfortable and ongoing coexis-
      tence of material and spiritual worlds. When interviewed by the authorities
      following the elders’ disappearance, mental institution employee Babo insists
      that they are “four, five hundred years old” (51), which suggests that, while they
      exist in the novel’s real world, they also incorporate ancestors from the spirit

      least four different categories of readers with some claim to insider knowledge,” and
      any one reader would require knowledge of all four fields in order to access it fully. In
      brief, these categories are Indigenous people, feminists, Canadians, and literary and
      historical scholars (226).

world who walk alongside their descendants on earth and continue to provide
them with assistance, a common trope in Indigenous cultural productions and
a significant factor in Indigenous religions.
     These four elders take turns narrating various versions of the stories along
with the trickster Coyote and a sixth narrator referred to only as “I,” effectively
suggesting Indigenous oral storytelling traditions. The four old men lampoon
historical accounts, creative literature, and Judeo-Christianity while assuming the
names of four white male heroes of Western culture: the Lone Ranger, Ishmael,
Robinson Crusoe, and Hawkeye (9). The other narrative stream consists of
creation-myth variations about four Indigenous women: First Woman, Changing
Woman, Thought Woman, and Old Woman (39, 104, 232, 328). King’s blending
of the two narrative streams unites the mythical stories of the distant past with
stories of the more recent past. The eventual blending of the narrative streams
into the new contemporary story suggests a similarity between residency in
the mental hospital and incarceration in Fort Marion, a prison in Florida to
which the US army sent any Indigenous “leaders opposed to the reservation
system” in 1874 (18, 397). The novel’s combining of the image of the hospital
and the image of the prison metaphorically suggests that Indigenous peoples
feel a type of imprisonment living within white society.
     The eventual juxtaposition of the narrative streams also blends the iden-
tities of the four old men into those of the four women. When interviewed
by Sergeant Cereno about the “escapees” from the hospital, employee Babo
reports that “they were women, not men,” disputing his claim that the “files
say the Indians were men” (53). This inconsistency contrasts white privileging
of written fact and Indigenous privileging of oral knowledge and the flexibility
of its truths. It also suggests that the old women may have been attempting
to masquerade as men, which in turn references the exacerbated injuries that
can result when people’s identities involve multiple layers of otherness, such as
being Indigenous, female, and old. The text references the felt need by Indig-
enous people to attempt to “pass” or survive within white culture by denying
their heritage and pretending to be something acceptable to white society.
Readers could also interpret this confusion over identity as referencing an
inability on the part of white culture to accurately perceive the Indigenous, or
they could alternatively interpret an elusiveness or preference for vague repre-
sentation on the part of the Indigenous. Or this confusing portrayal could be
a deliberate attempt by King to challenge Eurocentric preferences for binaries.
King’s prose is merely suggestive in these areas.
     Eventually, the four oppressed women/men and their mythical world
merge with the real world when the renamed mental patients magically “fix
the world” – at least a little – by intervening in the life of the Lone Ranger’s
misguided “grandson” Lionel, by helping their descendants to assemble again
as a community at the Sun Dance, and by reversing some of the humiliation
196   Patricia Life


      felt by Indigenous peoples by, for example, using historiographic metafictional
      techniques such as refilming a movie battle to show the Indigenous warriors
      defeating cowboy John Wayne (125, 322).
           In King’s fictional world, the aged ancestors are not incompetent male
      mental patients but rather knowledgeable yet humble elders out to “fix the
      world.” The four repeat this line a number of times: “We’re not on vacation …
      We’re working … We’re trying to fix up the world”; “‘It’s a lot of work fixing
      up this world, you know,’ said the Lone Ranger”; and “We are trying to fix the
      world” (123, 416, 418). Although they are presented in a humorous fashion and
      make mistakes, King indicates that they do have power to effect change. For
      instance, they talk to the trickster god Coyote and are granted his cooperation
      in starting an earthquake to get them to the other side of Big Muddy River (418).
           The old men leave to “fix the world,” but they also leave because the facility
      is a non-home that isolates them from their own Indigenous community.
      King lampoons white care options by creating the most powerful overbearing
      administrator of all.4 He names the administrator “Dr. Joe Hovaugh,” a play
      on the name Jehovah, thereby critiquing white care institutions by suggesting
      that Indigenous peoples are forced to live within a culture that is based on the
      Christian religion rather than on Indigenous spiritual traditions. King belittles
      Judeo-Christian mythology just as Judeo-Christians have belittled Indigenous
      mythology. The novel includes the following line at the beginning and again
      at the end, satirizing the Christian creation myth, replacing Jehovah with Joe
      Hovaugh sitting in a Garden of Eden facsimile: “Dr. Hovaugh sat in his chair
      behind his desk and looked out at the wall and the trees and the flowers and
      the swans on the blue-green pond in the garden, and he was pleased” (16, 425).
           When he notes that the old residents are missing, Dr. Hovaugh consults
      with the physician, Dr. John Eliot, a character named after a famous missionary
      who attempted to convert the Indigenous to Christianity in the 1600s. Hovaugh
      and Eliot ineffectively muse that the old residents must be dead because “they
      should have died … a long time ago” (47), thus making reference to the assump-
      tion of many that the Indigenous tribes would eventually die out or be assim-
      ilated into white culture. However, Dr. Eliot will not sign death certificates
      unless Dr. Hovaugh can produce four dead bodies: “What I can’t understand is
      how they escape. And where do they go? Have you ever thought about that Joe?
      And why, in God’s name, would they want to leave?” (48). Here the novel pokes
      fun at the common white assumption that white culture is superior to Indige-
      nous culture and that surely Indigenous people must realize this truth. King
      makes it clear that most Indigenous people avoid admission to white institu-
      tions such as late-life care facilities, not just because they are made uncomfort-

able due to the racist attitudes encountered there but also because they prefer
their own culture and consider it superior to white culture.
    King’s character Babo Jones, an African American, has been Dr. Hovaugh’s
employee at the institution for sixteen years, suggesting that King has noticed
how frequently white care facilities employ brown- or black-skinned people
as workers. The novel suggests that, like the old men, Babo has had white
culture thrust upon her. The name “Babo” references an African character who
violently resists being made a slave in Herman Melville’s “Benito Cereno,” a
story in which a captain and crew are overpowered by the Africans that they are
transporting for the purpose of selling into slavery. The slave Babo “determined
to kill his master, Don Alexandro Aranda, both because he and his compan-
ions could not otherwise be sure of their liberty, and … to prepare a warning”
(Melville 1107). King provocatively places this volatile character’s namesake in
the midst of Hovaugh’s supposed Garden of Eden. Thus the text is asking how
this institution can be seen as a god’s ideal garden when there are obvious
racial inequities between the management and the employee and inmates. By
including the African-American worker Babo in the story alongside the Indig-
enous residents, King emphasizes the felt racial separateness of Indigenous
and African-American peoples and what he considers to be the oblivious igno-
rance of elite white management. King points out that Indigenous and Afri-
can-American people lack a respected place in this white institution, or in any
white institution for that matter, and that therefore they would rather exclude
themselves from white culture. He suggests that white care administrations
remain largely oblivious to all the ways in which Indigenous needs differ from
mainstream needs.
    Discussion of appropriate venues and services for late-life care must extend
into a discussion of each person’s values, traditions, and prior sense of place.
Currently, services are not extended equally to all Canadians because govern-
ment-administered facilities generally provide care appropriate for the main-
stream resident and thus do not cater to the differing needs of those on the
margins. The nursing-home-narrative fiction published in Canada depicts
homes inhabited primarily by relatively privileged, white Anglo-Saxon Protes-
tant residents. In The Other Sister, Lola Lemire Tostevin depicts two Jewish resi-
dents, Lena Kohn and Daniel Browne, but in general, residents of white Anglo-
Saxon descent are the norm in Canadian nursing-home narratives (see Life).
    King makes it clear that Canada is not exempt from the charges of racism
he has applied toward the United States. When Babo and Hovaugh cross the
border into Canada to look for the old men, the border guard insists that “[a]ll
personal property must be registered,” thereby blatantly suggesting that Babo is
property rather than a person. King then writes: “Babo looked at the American
border station and then at the Canadian border station. ‘Where did you say we
were?’ she said.” King continues: “‘Welcome to Canada’ said the guard, and
198   Patricia Life


      she handed Dr. Hovaugh her clipboard” (237). The text thereby suggests that,
      despite Canada’s touted policy of multiculturalism, a person with black skin
      can expect to be treated as property in Canada.
          By placing this female African American as an employee alongside the old
      Indigenous male/female inmates in the institution and under the administra-
      tive leadership of the white male Joe Hovaugh, King aligns and speaks for the
      rights of oppressed Indigenous, old people, workers, African Americans, and
      women alike.
          In an article entitled “Sometimes It Works and Sometimes It Doesn’t”:
      Gender Blending and the Limits of Border Crossing in Green Grass, Running
      Water and Truth & Bright Water,” Suzanne Rintoul argues that King alludes to
      gender rights more broadly: “The four old Indians … expose the instability of
      the gender boundaries as established in European and North American culture:
      they are women who transition almost seamlessly to male figures” (239). One
      might assume that King depicts the residents as simply switching identities
      from female to male, but the novel also reduces the distinct divide between
      maleness and femaleness, suggesting instead more flexibility in gender
      identity and generally championing LGBTQ rights. The novel’s depiction of
      Moby-Jane’s and Changing Woman’s rejection of Ahab’s tyranny in favour of a
      relationship with each other is evident as they swim away together (187).
          Rintoul explains, however, that King’s discussion of gender is related
      specifically to Indigeneity and should be understood as being distinct from any
      general Western understanding of LGBTQ issues. She writes:

      The importance of avoiding a universalizing or simplistic approach to thinking about
      First Nations gender identity cannot be overstated here, particularly since King reminds
      his readers repeatedly of the interrelatedness of race and gender. As each of the four
      old Indians assumes the identity of a white colonialist man to circumvent imprisonment,
      King aligns masculinity with European racism, and femininity with First Nations subordi-
      nation. This process emphasizes the inadequacy of language that treats gender or race
      as discrete entities. (241)

      I might add that, while the category of gender seems slippery in this text, most
      of King’s categorizations are elusive in regard to boundaries.
          Rintoul continues by adding that “King’s four old Indians both trouble and
      reiterate European gender hierarchies,” but she also states that she does not by
      this position intend “to displace readings of the Indians as part of the trickster
      or ‘two-spirit’ traditions.” She summarizes the novel’s style by saying that, “in
      King’s fictional worlds, we cannot attach solitary meaning to any phenomenon”
      (241). As established above, when King writes about four old Indigenous men
      in a mental hospital under the care of Dr. Hovaugh, he is depicting the oppres-
      sion of Indigenous people by white governments and Judeo-Christian culture,
                                             Outside the Nursing-Home Narrative     199


and he is also depicting four old men in a care facility who may also be four old
women. I would add that the novel is saying all of that while also suggesting
that those four old people are multiply or flexibly gendered.
    For flexibly gendered Indigenous and for non-Indigenous LGBTQ individ-
uals, living in a late-life care facility may be a frightening prospect, and many
might prefer to avoid walking through the door. Where individuals may be
marginalized because of more than one factor, such as when they are both
gay and Indigenous, negotiating the prejudice within institutions becomes
even more challenging. If residency were to be unavoidable due to health and
economic reasons, some might retreat back into the closet, which would mean
that they then would be unable to receive visits from those people who were
important to them but who might cause them to be outed again.
    A US-based advocacy group called Services and Advocacy for Gay, Lesbian,
Bisexual and Transgender Elders (SAGE) states that “L.G.B.T. older people are
twice as likely to be single, and 3 to 4 times as likely to have no children –
and many are estranged from their biological families,” all of which results
in greater need for external supports in late life (Services 1). In Canada, some
LGBTQ-friendly late-life care homes are becoming available in major centres.
In Toronto, for example, two non-profit (Drs. Paul and John Rekai Centre and
Wellesley Central Place) and three municipally funded care homes (Fudger
House, Kipling Acres, True Davidson Acres) currently advertise themselves
on the web as friendly to the LGBTQ community (Toronto Nursing Homes 1).
However, LGBTQ-dedicated services are less available outside of major centres.
    Many aged people of a variety of descriptions remain without a suitable
support network to help them manage outside of an institution, and many
are justly frightened at the prospect of admission to a culturally unacceptable
facility.
    In Green Grass, Running Water, King depicts four old people who for a
variety of reasons walk away from a facility administered by white culture and
government. Although this novel was written in 1993, the issues King portrays
surrounding Indigeneity, gender identity, and aging continue to be of relevance
today. King’s text invites readers to think about intentional and unintentional
segregation of late-life care. Canada must encourage and facilitate the building
of more homes and services directed to the specific needs of the marginalized.
Kindness and good government require that care agents attempt to learn about
all of the aspects of home that have been significant in a senior’s life and try
to duplicate those qualities within the care facility or service. Until multicul-
turalism becomes more than just a written policy, care agents must attempt
to provide everyone with an environment in which they can, at the very least,
feel safe.

“The Bear Came over the Mountain”
and Sarah Polley’s Away from Her
Katrin Berndt and Jennifer Henke



This chapter discusses two examples of Canadian literature and film that offer
a progressive perspective on age by contemplating questions of loyalty and
commitment in a lifelong romantic relationship challenged by the impact of
dementia. Both set in a long-term residential-care home, Alice Munro’s short
story “The Bear Came over the Mountain” (2001) and Sarah Polley’s film Away
from Her (2006) focus on the continuities and disruptions that define the
tropes “love” and “age” in contemporary Canadian society. An adaptation of
Munro’s story, the film not only addresses change but represents itself the idea
of a productive connection between faithfulness and the creation of something
new. In Munro’s tale, this correlation is realized through the intimate “rela-
tionship between memory, fidelity, and adaptation, [... which] offers insights
into how [being committed to one’s partner] can adapt to changing conditions”
(McGill, “No Nation but Adaptation,” 98–99).
    In addition to conceptual emphasis and setting, the film and story share
their main themes, characters, plot, and the narrative sequence of events. They
depict the life of Fiona and Grant, a married couple in their seventies, who
are observed in their interactions before and after Fiona develops symptoms
of Alzheimer’s. After experiencing a series of increasingly frequent memory
failures, Fiona decides to move to a long-term care residence not far away from
their home. When Grant is allowed to visit his wife for the first time after the
thirty days’ settling-in period, she cannot remember who he is. Moreover, she
has become the companion of another patient, a physically paralyzed man
named Aubrey who watches her conversations with Grant with undisguised
jealousy. When Aubrey, who is only a temporary resident, is taken home again
by his wife, Fiona develops symptoms of depression: she refuses to eat and
spends much of her time crying. Grant’s attentions make no difference to her.
After a few weeks, the management considers moving her to the closed ward,
204   Katrin Berndt and Jennifer Henke


      where patients are cared for who no longer participate in the shared activities
      of the residence. To prevent this, Grant persuades Aubrey’s wife, Marian, to
      return him to the institution for good. The story ends with Grant announcing
      Aubrey’s return to Fiona, who suddenly recognizes Grant as her husband and
      acknowledges his loyalty to her. It remains unclear whether Fiona’s rediscovery
      of her memory will last, and whether seeing Aubrey again will actually improve
      her condition.
          Taking into account scholarly criticism of both works, this chapter discusses
      the structural interest of story and film in the values inherent in lifelong
      romantic commitment, which they view as depending on a balance between
      intimacy and emotional distance. On a discursive level, the progressive correla-
      tion between love and age is emphasized in the idea of adaptation and through
      the rendering of life as an ongoing narrative, which conveys meaning through
      changes of perspective, spatial relations, and varieties of narrative order such
      as analepsis and prolepsis. In addition, the article demonstrates that affection
      and dedication are represented through intertextuality and recurrent rhetor-
      ical schemes and tropes in the story, whereas Polley’s film uses landscapes
      and space to illustrate the partners’ struggle with the nature and form of their
      commitment. Both works of fiction insist on keeping love alive, suggesting that
      in old age, a reconsideration of the idea of loyalty might mark a new beginning.



      H umours of L ove and L oyalt y :
      “The B e ar C ame over the M ountain ” (2001)
      Alice Munro’s short story features several notable aspects that have become
      identified with her work for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Liter-
      ature in 2013. One of Canada’s foremost writers for several decades, her short
      stories have been unobtrusive yet highly articulate and valued contributions
      to the Canadian canon since the publication of her first collection, Dance of
      the Happy Shades (1968), which earned her Canada’s most prestigious literary
      distinction, the Governor General’s Award. Born as Alice Ann Laidlaw in 1931
      in Wingham, Ontario, Munro grew up on a farm in Huron County. She studied
      English and Journalism at the University of Western Ontario and published
      her first story in a student magazine. Her work to date includes fifteen original
      collections of short stories and several television scripts. In the 1990s, she
      settled down in Clinton, Ontario, where she continues to live.1
          Many of Munro’s stories describe the challenges and relationships of
      “women of her own generation,” who become adults after the Second World

      1 | Detailed overviews of Munro’s life and comprehensive discussions of her work can
      be found in Howells; Thacker; and Staines.

War and struggle to balance their longing for personal and professional
independence with emotional intimacy (McGill, “Alice Munro,” par. 18). The
security that marriage and family seem to promise is challenged in Munro’s
writing, which studies the myriad ways in which unfulfilled desires, disil-
lusionment, and discontent invade and undermine the stable framework of
social convention. Munro’s narratives are microcosms of Canadian lives in the
twentieth century: they explore female opportunities in a patriarchal world,
socioeconomic transformations, mother–daughter relationships, the vagaries
of marriage and friendship, rural upbringing, (the mystery of) love, and the
barriers of communication between individuals and within communities.
Munro’s preferred setting is rural Ontario, which shows an autobiographical
influence on her writing, as does her dealing with themes such as the loss of
parents and of children: her mother passed away comparatively young after
having had Parkinson’s disease for 20 years, and one of her own daughters died
shortly after birth (Thacker 147, 125).
    Several of Munro’s stories are arranged in a cyclical pattern, which portrays
events in the life of the protagonist at different stages and so combines elements
of the story collection and the novel (Nischik 199). The cycle also draws attention
to continuations and disruptions in characters’ lives and indicates the intertex-
tual and metafictional quality of subjective approaches to experience, memory,
and the subsequent reinterpretation of both. Munro has shown interest in
historiographic metafiction, a postmodern form of narration, which sheds light
on how fiction is created and, in so doing, on how a story becomes a subjec-
tive account of history (see Duncan 27, 130–31). According to Canadian critic
Linda Hutcheon, metafiction is a “process of creating order through myth and
art,” which gains historiographic significance when it is “grounded in histor-
ical, social, and political realities” (Hutcheon, Canadian Postmodern 2, 13). In
“The Bear Came over the Mountain,” sociocultural transformations such as
sexual liberation and second-wave feminism in the 1960s and 1970s, respec-
tively, form the background to the main character Grant’s reflection on his life.
The free indirect discourse of his memory reveals the associative and cognitive
limits of his recollections, characterizing him as both nostalgic and self-in-
volved. The story observes his reminiscing, though without passing judgment:
Isla Duncan stresses that in Munro’s writing, memory “is not always seen as
a source of guilt or a reminder of disappointment”; the self-conscious re-cre-
ation of one’s life “can sometimes be a means of escape, even a shelter,” and as
such it discloses “the interplay between characters’ past and present lives” (103).
Munro’s figurative language and rhetorical means reflect her interest in what
is, what has been, and what could have been: her allegories, allusions, para-
grams, enumerations, and similes construct scrupulously detailed versions of
ordinary life replete with hidden meanings, unsolved mysteries, suppressed
desires, and secrets kept and revealed. The fictional lives she conjures up do
206   Katrin Berndt and Jennifer Henke


      not necessarily follow a particular trajectory, as she explains in an interview:
      “I don’t take up a story and follow it as if it were a road, taking me somewhere,
      with views and neat diversions along the way. I go into it, and move back and
      forth and settle here and there, and stay in it for a while. It’s more like a house”
      (McCaig 93).
           And just as it takes a while to feel at home in a new place of residence,
      Munro’s stories require more than one reading to become familiar with all
      their hidden nooks and crannies. This is certainly the case with “The Bear
      Came over the Mountain,” which was first published in her collection Hateship,
      Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage (2001). Gradually revealing the
      self-involved quality of the main character’s view on his marriage, the narra-
      tive investigates the form that love assumes when one partner suffers from a
      degenerative disease. The story is one of several in Munro’s 2001 collection
      that address the endurance of both love and commitment under circumstances
      such as misfortune, adversities, and a variety of severe strokes of fate: apart
      from what appears to be Alzheimer’s in “The Bear Came over the Mountain,”
      the collection’s contributions deal with infertility, cancer, and suicide. As a
      reviewer points out, however, “in none of these stories do things go from very
      bad to worse” (Pritchard, par. 5). Munro is more interested in exploring what
      such afflictions can unearth and encourage in people’s thinking and in their
      attitudes toward one another than in indulging in elaborate, emotive renditions
      of human suffering.
           The revelations disclosed by Fiona’s degenerative disease revolve around the
      couple’s marriage and their life together, which, according to Grant, was a fairly
      good one, “without too much going wrong” (Munro 306). Told from a third-
      person perspective, the story is seen through his eyes, an unusual focalization
      in Munro’s work, which more often features the point of view of female protag-
      onists. In contrast to many of her women characters, Grant does not want intel-
      lectual or professional independence, both of which he has always enjoyed: he
      struggles to remain emotionally close to his wife although she has forgotten the
      life they once shared. His efforts slowly reveal that even before Fiona’s illness,
      their relationship had been characterized by a careful balance of distance and
      intimacy that has enabled her in particular to retain her dignity during Grant’s
      extramarital affairs. Grant’s apparently noble and selfless gesture – his efforts
      to organize Aubrey’s return to the residential home to stabilize Fiona’s health,
      even at the cost of her being the companion of another man – appear as an
      attempt to make amends for betraying her in the past. According to Robert
      McGill, Munro’s story “explore[s] the very question of what it means to be
      faithful” when it integrates “Grant’s own possible adultery ... into the project of
      seeking Fiona’s well-being, so that in the story, adaptation and infidelity seem
      to go hand in hand as activities necessary for happiness” (“No Nation” 100, 101).
                                                           Love, Age, and Loyalty   207


    The story uses a combination of intertextual references and shifting narra-
tive modes to portray both Fiona and Grant’s love for one another and the
tension between dedication and distance in their relationship. Particularly
interesting for a narrative that explores mature romance in a care home is that
the title of Munro’s story is an adaptation of a North American nursery rhyme,
an oral genre associated with childhood. The rhyme “The Bear Went over the
Mountain” mocks an adventurous bear in repetitive verses and produces an
odd contrast to the themes of the story:

   The bear went over the mountain,
   The bear went over the mountain,
   The bear went over the mountain,
   To see what he could see.
   And what do you think he saw?
   And what do you think he saw?
   The other side of the mountain,
   The other side of the mountain,
   The other side of the mountain,
   Was all that he could see.
   (Ventura 174)

In her analysis of Munro’s intertextual references, Héliane Ventura suggests
that the rhyme is merely a “self-parodic play on words, which relies on the
opening up of expectations only to frustrate curiosity with the platitude of
a tautological closure,” because “[t]he world that the bear discovers is just
as ordinary as the one he has just left” (174, 175). The rhyme introduces into
the story the “tradition of ‘Nonsense’ as evidenced in the writings of Lewis
Carroll and [Edward] Lear” in order to mock “all our expectations of heroic
aggrandizement and magic discovery” (175). Such parody suggests reading
Grant’s behaviour as essentially self-serving rather than self-sacrificing, which
is supported by the story’s indication that he begins an affair with Marian,
Aubrey’s wife.
    In the figurative context of Munro’s story, however, the emphasis of the
rhyme lies on the shift of situation and perspective, which in itself is the
discovery of something extraordinary. This interpretation is confirmed by the
author’s choice of words: in contrast to the original nursery rhyme, Munro’s
“bear” does not go “to see what he could see”; he comes over the mountain, a
different verb which suggests a deliberate advance to somebody rather than
the mere following of a curious impulse. Moreover, given Grant’s previous
adultery, it is not self-evident that he would not “go,” that is simply leave his
wife now that she has forgotten him, but that he decides to “come over,” to make
an effort to approach Fiona in order to remain emotionally close to her. “On
208   Katrin Berndt and Jennifer Henke


      the other side,” he then finds himself surprised “to see what [s]he could see.”
      His wife’s condition compels him to move to the other side, where he begins
      to consider her view of him and his actions. This shift is involved in another
      meaning of coming over, which denotes a change of allegiance: forced by Fiona’s
      illness to assume a new perspective, Grant is not only given the opportunity to
      view their life together from his wife’s point of view; the accompanying reali-
      zation also gives him the chance to show loyalty to her, and to his feelings for
      her. Reading Grant as “the bear” who comes over to the other side grants him a
      change of view on their marriage and the subsequent opportunity to commit
      himself to her well-being.
           The new perspective conveyed by the connotations of the title corresponds
      with the changing focus in the narrative mode: on the morning before Grant
      visits Fiona for the first time, he experiences a “tingling” of anticipation that
      announces his “expectation of discovery,” which is contrasted with feelings of
      “timidity, humility, alarm” (Munro 287, 288). In the residence, the narrative
      shifts from sharing Grant’s sensations to reporting his meticulous observa-
      tion of the care home as well as the people and activities he encounters there.
      This enumeration of spatial and individual details serves several purposes.
      Sara Jamieson has pointed out that in contemporary Canadian fiction, residen-
      tial-care homes are no longer represented solely “as institutions to be avoided
      or escaped,” and that Alice Munro’s stories in particular portray “the old age
      home in a way that turns a critical eye to its disadvantages, yet also remains
      open to how those disadvantages might be mitigated and a habitable existence
      sustained” (2). Grant’s observations in “The Bear Came over the Mountain”
      illustrate this aspect: the generous design and bright atmosphere of Meadow-
      lake painstakingly avoid any association with enforced placement but instead
      illustrate his desire to see the elderly inhabitants comfortably located in what
      is now their home: “[The nurse] led him along a hall, into the light of the huge
      sky windows in the large central space, with its cathedral ceiling. Some people
      were sitting along the walls, in easy chairs, others at tables in the middle of
      the carpeted floor. None of them looked too bad. Old – some of them inca-
      pacitated enough to need wheelchairs – but decent” (Munro 289). When he
      finally sees Fiona, however, his emotional response to the place alters. Grant
      continues his detailed description, noticing the changes in his wife’s clothes
      and her hair, but now his observations reveal his confusion. Her new home is
      no longer his, and he will soon get lost in the residence, literally and emotion-
      ally: “On the other side of the mountain,” he suddenly finds himself alone
      in their marriage. Being with Fiona now includes the feeling of being away
      from her: “He could not throw his arms around her. Something about her
      voice and smile, familiar as they were, something about the way she seemed
      to be guarding the players and even the coffee woman from him – as well as
      him from their displeasure – made that not possible” (290). When he encoun-
                                                                 Love, Age, and Loyalty     209


ters the changed Fiona in the care home, Grant’s feelings are rendered mute,
leaving a blank space, an intimate omission that is resolved only at the very end
of the story.
    In his attempt to fill the emotional void that Fiona’s disease has created,
Grant looks back on their life together; he recalls their first encounter, the
particularities of their marriage, and his repeated unfaithfulness to his wife.
In typically ambivalent Munro fashion, Grant’s reminiscing about his affairs
emphasizes both his love for his wife and his lack of consideration for her
feelings at the time. The independence he enjoyed has included betrayal. It is
another characteristic of Munro’s writing, however, that the reader can never
be sure that Fiona even knew about Grant’s affairs, or if she did, whether she
was bothered by them. The narrative focuses exclusively on Grant’s percep-
tion, which presents him as a philanderer who took advantage of the promis-
cuous opportunities of the late 1960s. In the story of their marriage in these
years, Fiona is presented only through his eyes; her feelings and opinions are
presumed only, and through his memory:

A whirlwind hit him, as it did many others, wish becoming action in a way that made him
wonder if there wasn’t something missed. But who had time for regrets? He heard of
simultaneous liaisons, savage and risky encounters. [...] Academic parties, which used
to be so predictable, became a minefield. An epidemic had broken out, it was spreading
like the Spanish flu. Only this time people ran after contagion, and few between sixteen
and sixty seemed willing to be left out.
Fiona appeared to be quite willing, however. Her mother was dying, and her experience
in the hospital led her from her routine work in the registrar’s office into her new job.
(302)

While Grant is happy to run with the crowd, Fiona starts working as a “hospital
coordinator of volunteer services (in that everyday world, as she said, where
people actually had troubles that were not related to drugs or sex or intellectual
squabbles)” (287).2 He takes note of the fact that she appears to be uninterested
in sexual encounters with others, but he does not question her “unwilling-
ness.” Moreover, his own retrospective view characterizes him as a narcissistic

2 | Robert McGill discusses Munro’s ambivalent portrayal of sexual liberation as a
feature of her general skepticism toward historical progress: “Munro’s stories set during
the 1960s and ’70s, in particular, suggest that for all that was accomplished by the
Women’s Liberation Movement with regard to things such as divorce laws, abortion
rights, and the availability of contraception, society has remained fundamentally sexist
in important ways. [... In “The Bear Came over the Mountain”], Munro characterizes the
era of ‘free love’ principally as a time in which husbands became freer to cheat on and
leave their wives” (“Alice Munro and Personal Development” 147).
210   Katrin Berndt and Jennifer Henke


      man3 who only regrets that he missed the signs of the times at the dawn of
      second-wave feminism, when his approaches to his female students were no
      longer considered welcome:

      The shame he felt then was the shame of being duped, of not having noticed the change
      that was going on. And not one woman had made him aware of it. There had been the
      change in the past when so many women so suddenly became available ... and now this
      new change, when they were saying that what had happened was not what they had
      had in mind at all. ... All so that he could now find himself accused of wounding and
      exploiting and destroying self-esteem. And of deceiving Fiona – as of course he had
      deceived her – but would it have been better if he had done as others had done with
      their wives and left her?
      He had never thought of such a thing. He had never stopped making love to Fiona in
      spite of disturbing demands elsewhere. He had not stayed away from her for a single
      night. (286)

      Congratulating himself on the uninterrupted continuity of his sexual perfor-
      mance, Grant takes up a phrase that is used at the beginning of the story,
      and which also becomes the title of Polley’s film. The young Fiona proposed
      to Grant with the words, “Do you think it would be fun if we got married?,”
      and he realized then that he “wanted never to be away from her. She had the
      spark of life” (276). And while he made sure indeed not to spend nights away
      from her, the ways in which Grant has actually been with his wife are conspic-
      uously absent from his narrative. He recollects neither caring for her during
      her mother’s decline nor being sympathetic at the news that Fiona cannot have
      children: “Something about her tubes being blocked, or twisted – Grant could
      not remember now. He had always avoided thinking about all that female appa-
      ratus” (279). His lack of regard suggests that the “fun” she was having with him
      had been morphed into puns, irony, and comic paragrams that allowed Fiona
      to share her life with Grant while keeping him at an emotional distance. He
      does not question her use of humour before the disease breaks out; Grant sees
      Fiona as a “direct and vague, ... sweet and ironic” (277) woman, whose apparent
      indifference toward his affairs places him in the comfortable position of never
      having to justify himself.
          It is only Fiona’s illness that eventually confronts Grant with his repressed
      but lingering uneasiness about this blank space in their relationship: did she

      3 | “Grant is represented … as a narcissistic and egomaniac philanderer [... who, in
      spite of] his having had a great many affairs, ... has never left Fiona and the final act
      he indulges in acquires an ambiguously redeeming dimension” (Ventura 179). Grant’s
      narcissism is also illustrated by the Narcissus flowers he buys for Fiona upon his first
      visit in the residential-care institution (McGill, “Mistaken Identities” 71; Munro 288).
                                                                  Love, Age, and Loyalty      211


know about his unfaithfulness, he wonders, and does she now play “some kind
of charade” (294) in order to punish him? After all, Fiona’s verbal games are so
much a part of her personality that her memory loss in the residence might be
merely another one of her frequent jokes:

He could not decide. She could have been playing a joke. It would not be unlike her. She
had given herself away by that little pretense at the end, talking to him as if she thought
perhaps he was a new resident.
If that was what she was pretending. If it was a pretense. (292)

Over the years of their marriage, Grant has become used to Fiona’s playfulness;
sharing puns even became part of their routines as a couple. Fiona’s illness
and Grant’s subsequent change of perspective forces him not only to accept
that she is no longer joking – it also confronts him with the possibility that
her humorous comments in the past were not meant to be funny, after all.
Ironically, Fiona’s dementia unearths the unreliable “memory on the part of
the supposedly rational, healthy, and normal care provider” (Goldman and
Powell 85). In order to adapt to the new situation, Grant now has to reconsider
his established knowledge about their marriage; his failure to “read” his wife
in the present initiates his recollection of a past in which he already might have
misunderstood her. Grant’s new perspective – his adaptation to the changing
circumstances of his commitment to Fiona – confronts him with his own
dormant feelings of guilt and, eventually, with his continued penchant for flir-
tatious games and amorous manipulations.
    In two further ironic twists of romantic commitment, Grant has to secure
his wife’s well-being by organizing Aubrey’s return to the residence, which
involves Aubrey’s wife Marian’s cautious attempt to initiate some form of rela-
tionship with Grant. Her advances lack any tender appeal: during their conver-
sation, she makes it clear that placing Aubrey in the care institution perma-
nently would render her homeless and without financial provision. When she
calls Grant to suggest a social meeting, she indicates a solution that would grant
both of them what they want. However, in so doing, Marian reveals insecurity
and want, something that calls forth Grant’s old habits of erotic scheming and
manoeuvring:

It gave him satisfaction – why deny it? – to have brought that out in her. To have roused
something like a shimmer, a blurring, on the surface of her personality. ... Anything was
possible. Was that true – was anything possible? ... It would be a challenge. A challenge
and a creditable feat. Also a joke that could never be confided to anybody – to think that
by his bad behavior he’d be doing good for Fiona. (320)
212   Katrin Berndt and Jennifer Henke


      The sequence of events absolves Grant to an extent, for he had contacted Marian
      first in order to persuade her to allow Aubrey return to the residence for Fiona’s
      sake. Nevertheless, Grant indulges in the knowledge that Marian might be
      attracted to him, and considers triumphantly (“a creditable feat”) the prospect
      of an affair with her.
           Munro conjures up a wonderfully intricate net that intertwines her charac-
      ters’ different fictions of their intentions when she combines Fiona’s longing
      for Aubrey with Grant’s willingness to ensure her happiness and his relapse
      into his philandering past. His wife’s loss of memory, her weakened condi-
      tion and depression, which had provided Grant with the chance to show some
      disinterested motivation himself, puts him in a situation that seems to give
      him not only the moral right, but the obligation to be unfaithful again. In fact,
      he is being rewarded for being loyal with the prospect of another infidelity.
      This portrayal of mature romance in a nursing home “juxtaposes the sublime
      and the farcical, the weird and the noble, the heretic and the pragmatic, on the
      threshold between life and death, in a senior citizen’s residence” (Ventura 179).
      The story presents love in the winter of life without any “pathos and self-pity in
      order to favour a playful, distanced, and ironic approach to the ravages of aging”
      that pursues nothing less than a reconsideration of the essential meaning of
      commitment (Ventura 174). To be dedicated to somebody, the story suggests,
      is an ongoing process of transformation and adaptation to new situations and
      challenges. This understanding of mature love as progressing still allows the
      characters to ignore, for the time being, what is otherwise associated with old
      age: loss of self, deterioration, and death. At the end of Munro’s narrative, Fiona
      and Grant refuse to let their marriage come to a close: for a brief moment, in
      their final encounter, they celebrate their love, allowing themselves to enjoy the
      possibility of a shared future.
           The last scene shows them alone once more in Fiona’s private room in the
      retirement home. Suddenly recognizing Grant as her husband, Fiona’s habit-
      ually ironic mode becomes charged with a melancholic acknowledgement of
      their past and their present situation, as she resorts to another paragram and
      takes into tender account Grant’s decision to come over to his wife after all:
      “You could have just driven away [...] Just driven away without a care in the
      world and forsook me. Forsooken me. Forsaken” (Munro 323). Grant responds
      to her return to their playful mode with another enumeration of her features,
      listing them like the details of the residence upon his first visit, but now with
      a regained sense of familiarity, which indicates his feeling at home, now, with
      her, on the other side: “He kept his face against her white hair, her pink scalp,
      her sweetly shaped skull. He said, Not a chance” (323).

S paces of L ove and A ge : A way from H er (2006)
The idea of shared life and love as a journey that continues even after one of the
partners relocates to a care home also features in Polley’s film, whose promo-
tional tagline claims that “It’s never too late to become what you might have
been.”4 The second part of this chapter turns to Sarah Polley’s cinematic appro-
priation of Munro’s short story to address notions of adaptation, love, and age,
as well as space and care. It focuses particularly on how the film continues
Grant and Fiona’s story in the new spatial context of the nursing home and the
necessary changes of perspective that long-term residential care involves.
    This section illuminates the key issues of love and age by exten­ding a
reading of these themes to a cinematographic level. In addition, it sheds light
on the director’s motivations to adapt Munro’s short story and discusses the
actual meaning of loyalty (McGill, “No Nation” 100). During the following
analysis of selected film scenes, the notion of space as a carrier of meaning
looms large as it contributes to the understanding of both pre-text and adapta-
tion in terms of love, age, and care.
    Away from Her (2006), a movie about an elderly couple confronted with a
geriatric disease, is the debut film of Canadian director Sarah Polley, herself
aged on­ly 27 at the time it was released. When asked in an interview by Brian D.
Johnson about “what drives a woman in her 20s to devote her feature directing
debut to a story of old folks losing their grip” (Johnson, par. 2), Pol­ley indicates
that she first read Munro’s short story at the age of 21, freshly in love with her
future (and now former) husband. She adds: “I was shell-shocked. I found it
so moving … It just sat there for a couple of years … this vision of a film that
wouldn’t go away” (par. 1). The last word of Polley’s reply already alludes to the
mo­v ie’s title and its intrinsic semantics of intimacy and distance. At the same
time, it raises the questions of who moves away from whom, why, and how.
Further, what role do love and age play in this context?
    According to Polley’s statements, she instantly fell in love with Munro’s
short sto­r y. She blamed her enthusiasm on young love and her own budding
relationship with the film editor of Away from Her, her first husband David
Wharnsby: “The idea of a long marriage became fascinating to me. … What
does [love] look like after decades – after you’ve failed each other? That became
so much more interesting to me than a traditional love story about people when

4 | McGill, “No Nation” 109. The quotation “It’s never too late to be who you might
have been” has been attributed to George Eliot since the nineteenth century, but it is
not contained in any of the writer’s publications (Mead); the phrase is also the title
of a motivational publication (Gallagher). The slightly modified “It’s never too late to
become what you might have been” is the title of a song about “sinners with the best
intentions” by the US band Cities Never Sleep.

      they’re young and dumb and boring” (Johnson, par. 3). What also drove Polley
      to produce this film was a biographical fate she shares with Alice Munro: both
      lost a close relative at a very early age. When Polley was 11, her mother died
      of cancer. Similarly, Munro had to face her mother’s diagnosis with Parkin-
      son’s disease at the age of 10 and nursed her for another 18 years.5 Moreover, in
      her 20s Polley had to experience the illness and death of her maternal grand-
      mother, who suffered from Alzheimer’s (Casal 136). Both Munro and Polley are
      therefore very familiar with what it means to care for an ill or old relative. It is
      very likely that the film production helped Polley cope with her experiences, as
      McGill (“No Nation” 105) and Sally Chivers (86) point out.
          Polley’s childhood and younger years were exceptional for further rea­sons.
      Born in Toronto in 1979, she was in contact with the film industry at the age of
      four, signed up for her first movie when she was six, and quickly developed into
      a child star who featured in various Canadian series, Disney films, and other
      international movies. After dropping out of school at 14, she moved into her
      own apartment and became engaged in left-wing politics for some time. Polley
      returned to the screen in the late 1990s and starred in numerous Canadian
      and Hollywood movies, many of them independent productions. Her debut
      film Away from Her received two Oscar nominations for best leading actress
      (Julie Christie) and best adaptation. Polley has produced two more Ca­na­dian
      feature films so far: Take This Waltz (2011) and Stories We Tell (2012), the latter
      a documentary about her own family. Interestingly, all three films negotiate
      questions of love, age, memory, shifting perspectives, adap­ta­tion, and fidelity.
      Polley is currently producing the CBC miniseries Alias Grace, an adaptation of
      the award-winning novel by Margaret Atwood, which will be released globally
      in 2017.
          With regard to the question of who adapts to whom, why, and how, McGill
      has argued that Polley’s Away from Her is not only an adaptation but also a
      “text about adaptation” (“No Nation” 99; emphasis in original), which “aligns
      adap­ta­tion with love” (100) on several levels of meaning. Not only does Polley
      artistically adapt (to) the source text out of love for Munro’s short story on an
      extra­textual level, but the fictional characters of the film themselves are also
      confronted with notions of memory, fidelity, and the necessity to which they
      have to adapt. In fact, the film’s plot mir­rors the process of artistic adaptation
      in a particularly striking manner. After Fiona’s diagnosis, the couple adapt to
      their new situation and environment in a similar way in which the filmmaker
      Polley adapts to the source text: both disregard notions of fidelity. According to
      Linda Hutcheon’s adaptation theory, “faithfulness” – that is, fidelity criticism –

      5 | The personal difficulties of nursing a relative with Parkinson’s disease are also
      reflected in Munro’s short story “The Peace of Utrecht,” published in The Dance of the
      Happy Shades (1968) (Albertazzi 5).

is an outdated concept (Theory 6–7). Instead, Hutcheon regards adaptations as
“ongoing dialogical process[es]” (21)6 between pre-text and adaptation in which
neither is valued over the other. On a discursive level, the same holds true for
Grant and Fiona as well as for Polley. However, the more the adapter attempts
to adhere to the “original,” the less likely she or he is to succeed. Hutcheon
proposes “repetition with variation” (4) as the key factor in an adaptation’s
effectiveness, as it is the play with memory and deviation that evokes pleasure
in the audience. Simi­lar­ly, Grant has to adapt to the new situation in the resi-
dential home by continuing to care for and thus remain “faithful” to Fiona. His
deviation is stronger in the film version, as Polley ex­pli­citly depicts him having
an affair with Marian (Olympia Dukakis). Nevertheless, Grant can achieve his
own personal loyalty to his wife only by shifting his perspective and trans-
forming from “jea­lous husband to procurer of romance for Fiona” (McGill, “No
Nation” 100).
    The movie’s title, which differs from the one Munro chose for her short
story, already offers a variety of readings in terms of changing perspectives.
While Grant (Gordon Pinsent) can be identified as the “bear” who needs to
“come over the mountain” and thus shift his perspective, the film’s title is
a direct quotation of one of Grant’s early memories of Fiona (Julie Christie)
(Munro 276) but is somewhat equivocal. Whereas Munro’s title raises the
questions “what bear, what mountain?,” Polley’s choice makes the audience
wonder “who is she?” and “who is the one moving away, why, and how?” On
a diegetic level, the suggested spatial relation of this title refers to Grant’s
unfaithfulness during their marriage. Further, it alludes to Fiona’s abandon-
ment of Grant after she moves into the care institution and forgets who he is.
It can also be read as Aubrey’s (Michael Murphy) departure from the nursing
home that triggers Fiona’s severe depression and subsequently leads to Grant’s
decision to support their reunion. Against the backdrop of artistic adaptation,
McGill stresses the “necessity [of] certain infidelities within the parameters
of a broader loyalty to the original text” (“No Nation” 102). Like Grant, Polley
needs to detach from her love object (Munro’s short story) in order to remain
“faithful.”7 The director has to avoid mere mimicry as it would inevitably lead
to artistic failure (Herrera 108). Thus, for both Polley and Grant the lines
between fidelity and infidelity become blurred. The filmmaker achieves her

6 | By referring to Amelia DeFalco, Jamieson likewise points to “aging as a process” (2),
which in turn can be regarded as a form of constant adaptation to new situations and
surroundings.
7 | Ironically, the German translation of the movie title reads An Ihrer Seite, which
means “by her side,” a phrase that lacks the semantic ambiguity of the original. On the
other hand, the German title corresponds to the paratexts of the movie – namely the
DVD cover and poster – which depict the loving couple in intimate proximity.

      goal to produce a successful adaptation not only by adding new scenes that
      slightly alter Munro’s plot but moreover by her clever use of “a wide range of
      cinematic devices” to “mirror Munro’s disruptive chronology” characterized
      by Grant’s memories or flash­backs (Herrera 109, 113). The transfer of Munro’s
      narrative into a visual medium is one of the key advantages of this adaptation,
      as “memories materialize, become images” on the space of the movie screen,
      as Agnès Berthin-Scaillet points out (2). It is arguably the case that Polley is
      to the film what Grant is to Munro’s story: the bear who must “come over the
      mountain.” The young filmmaker has to shift perspective in order to “survive”
      artistically when dealing with a long-term love relationship of an elderly couple
      confronted with the necessity of residential care.
          This change of perspective is apparent also on a cinematographic level, and
      the discussion will now turn to showing how the film text constructs Grant’s
      transformation from jealous partner to provider of love and care for Fiona, a
      shift occasioned by his wife’s relocation to the care home. The analysis focuses
      on different aspects of space as carriers of meaning and it will demonstrate
      that space itself, as a product of culturally coded signs, can fulfill a sym­bolic
      function. Movements through space, for instance, not only by characters but
      also by the camera, contribute to the meaning of a text. Physical spaces can
      likewise be read symbolically and thus extend the interpretation of a narrative.
      Further, the use of light and colour creates an atmosphere that functions as a
      reflection of the protagonist’s mood or general state of mind. With regard to the
      shift in perspective, the analysis will particularly focus on spaces of transition,
      which include certain locations such as cars, snowy landscapes, homes, care
      homes, beds, and corridors that are symbolically enhanced and contribute to
      realize the change in perspec­tive on an audio-visual level.
          Polley’s movie begins in medias res with a medium shot of Grant driving
      through a housing estate in his car on a winter’s day. The camera pans to the
      right and displays a note in his hand, on which is written Marian and Aubrey’s
      home address. Shortly after, the came­ra pans back to Grant’s face and then
      fades to a greyish and grainy close-up of a young, blonde, smiling woman –
      Fiona. She is shot in front of what seems to be a sea­shore. In a voice-over we
      hear Grant’s voice recalling: “She said, do you think it would be fun if we
      got married?” A female voice asks: “Then what did you say?” Grant replies
      off screen: “I took her up on it. I never wanted to be away from her. She had
      the spark of life.” After this conversation, the young woman’s lip movements
      indicate the sentence “What do you think?” Finally, the camera fades to white
      (Away from Her 00:00:00–00:01:07).
          Grant’s movement in his car through the housing estate echoes former
      events that will be narrated in retrospect as the movie proceeds. The way he
      moves around in his vehicle, seemingly disoriented and relying on a note he
      holds in his hand, recalls how Fiona relies on notes she sticks to things in
                                                                 Love, Age, and Loyalty     217


their house before she moves to the old-age home Meadowlake. Grant’s car
thus functions as a vehicle or (meta-)space of transition: he is on his way to
Marian in order to ask her to move Aubrey back to the nursing home and is
hence forced to change his perspective on love, age, and the notion of loyalty. It
is in this space (the car) that he is actively about to “come over the mountain”
right from the film’s exposition. The subsequent fade to Grant’s memory of
Fiona fur­ther aligns love with time or age and interconnects the past with
the present. The juxtaposition of Grant’s elderly complexion with the image
of Fiona’s younger self combined with her playful question regarding their
engagement indicates one of Grant’s “cheerful” flash­backs. Recalling Berthin-
Scaillet, Grant’s memories materialize on the film screen. This constitutes the
benefit of the medium as the words of the short story transform to images on
screen. In Polley’s movie the seashore functions as a spatial metaphor for both
remembrance and the loss of memory, especially with regard to Fiona’s deterio-
rating mental state, triggered by her dementia.8 In terms of spatial metaphors,
Fiona’s depiction in front of a sea­shore amplifies the cinematographic effect of
reminiscence; in this case it points to Grant’s own perspective on his long-term
marriage.
    What follows after the final fade of the first sequence is a medium pan shot
of two parallel tracks on a snowy surface. The camera then moves upwards
and we see a two shot of a couple from behind who are following the tracks.
The skiing characters, Grant and Fiona, then move away from the audience’s
perspective into the vast landscape. The next full shot depicts Fiona skiing
to the left of the screen frame on her own tracks while Grant takes a slightly
different direction in the background, only to join her again in the next shot.
Both of them are reunited in their parallel tracks and continue to move toward
a house in the distance. The scene ends with another white cross-fade and the
inserts Away from Her.
    Two aspects of this scene are remarkable: first, the dominance of snow, and
second, Grant’s temporary deviation from their common tracks. The snowy
landscapes serve as a spatial leit­mo­tif in the film; they appear at the beginning,
in the middle and the end of the film, thus framing the narrative. Of partic-
ular importance in this scene is Grant’s movement through space. Against the
backdrop of love and age, his temporary devia­tion from the couple’s common
tracks serves a symbolic function on three levels: first, they visualize Grant’s

8 | Chivers as well as Goldman and Powell identify these flashbacks as “ironic lapses
in memory” (Goldman and Powell 85) with regard to Grant, who from now on can “settle
into his unchanging ways” (Chivers 92) as a disloyal husband only wishing to care for
his equally disloyal wife. According to Chivers, Polley uses Alzheimer’s, a disease asso-
ciated with old age, “as a metaphor for infidelity” (92; Goldman and Powell 91), thus
aligning love, age, and loyalty on an audio-visual level.
218   Katrin Berndt and Jennifer Henke


      former affairs with his students while never “leaving” his wife; second, they
      allude to his seemingly selfless distancing from Fio­na by bringing Aubrey back
      to the nursing home; and third, they hint at his eventual return to their shared
      path (followed by the cross-fade and the inserts Away from Her), which expresses
      his faithfulness to Fiona. The visuals alone suffice to evoke the idea that a
      successful long-term relationship depends on a balance between intimacy and
      distance. Berthin-Scaillet emphasizes that “this … series of shots dissolving
      into each other provides the choreography of the couple’s life in common, on a
      filmic scale” (5). Furthermore, the spatial metaphor just described also works
      on a discur­sive level, as Polley has to achieve a careful balancing between
      intimacy and distance, pre-text and adaptation, faithfulness and deviation. In
      Ber­thin-Scaillet’s words, she “successfully follows the tracks of Munro’s text”
      (3). Like Grant she needs to temporarily move away from her (i.e., Munro) in
      order to accomplish a successful and durable adaptation. Polley achieves this
      deviation by adding new scenes and deleting or maintaining others, thus
      adhering to the artistic rule of “repetition with variation” stressed by Hutcheon
      (Theory). In the end, both Polley and Grant remain faithful precisely because
      loyalty involves an occasional departure from the main track. However, this
      reading renders Grant’s actions selfless and altruistic whereas his behaviour is
      rather self-serving than benevolent. One important variation of Polley’s movie
      un­der­lines this reading, as it shows Grant and Marian actually having an affair
      instead of him only fantasizing about it, as he does in Munro’s short story. The
      film depicts the two of them in bed in what seems to be a “post-coital embrace”
      (Goldman and Powell 90). Here, the bed functions as one of the film’s spaces
      of transitions and underlines the symbolic potential of spatial representations.
           The first part of the movie displays the couple in their cottage in a medium
      two shot in an exchange of affection, Grant on the left and Fiona on the right
      side of the bed. The camera then fades to white and repeatedly displays Grant
      driving in a car on his way to Marian and Aubrey’s house (00:04:21–00:04:50).
      The bed scenes are reiterated throughout the film, but with variation: shortly
      after Fiona decides to move to the care home Meadowlake, the main couple is
      depicted in exactly the same two shot in bed, their backs turned to one another
      this time. While Grant sleeps, Fiona leaves the film frame, thus leaving the
      right side of the bed empty. In contrast to the previous skiing scene, she is the
      one creating a distance between the two (00:27:46–00:28:10). In a later bed
      scene during the last night they spend to­gether in the residential home, Grant
      in turn exits the frame after Fiona tells him to “go now,” leaving an empty space
      on the left side of the bed (00:36:45–00:37:36). In the second part of the movie,
      Polley films Grant and Marian in a similar two shot in bed after the characters
      have evidently slept together (01:33:39–01:43:06). This time, however, Grant is
      situated on the right side, which can be read as an indicator that he has finally
      “come over the mountain.” For Berthin-Scaillet, these repeated shots and
                                                             Love, Age, and Loyalty    219


sequences are to be in­ter­pre­ted as a kind of “inverted mirror image” in order
to visualize the “feeling of estrange­ment from his wife that Grant has to cope
with. … Everything is repeated but inver­ted” (5). The beds of Grant, Fiona, and
Marian thus function as spaces of tran­si­tion: not only is Fiona never the same
again after her husband leaves her in the nursing home, but it is here also that
Grant finally grants his wife more free space. Beyond that, he literally fills his
own empty space with a new lover. Grant’s (sexual) relationship with Marian
is of particular importance to Polley’s artistic strategy. The images fill in the
blank spaces of the pre-text: Munro’s short story only hints at a sexual relation-
ship between Grant and Marian, while the film text materializes his fantasies.
     Another metaphor representing love, loyalty, and age and the necessary shift
in perspective is the opposition “home vs. care home.” To begin with, Grant’s
and Fiona’s “home,” their house in the countryside, represents their shared
memories. When Fiona sets out for a trip on her skis, this time alone, she gets
lost in the snowy woods close to their cottage (00:14:49–00:16:07). The camera
displays her in a frontal medium shot outside of their home, to which she turns,
clearly confused, and then wanders off into oblivion. She later lies down in the
snow, the camera shooting her from a bird’s eye per­spective until the screen
fades into the night sky. This scene serves as a turning point with regard to
her deteriorating mental condition. The snowy landscape, combined with the
camera technique, nicely illustrates the “blank page[s] of lost memory” (Johnson,
par. 16). As Herrera emphasizes, “The movement of the camera, zooming over
her as it circles down from above, adds to the sensation of utter loss” (115). There
is a similar scene later in the film in which Grant is shot from exactly the same
angle in front of their house (00:41:52–00:42:38). He, too, turns around to look
at their home – a signifier of their marriage and memories – in an obvious
example of remembering, while he compares Alzheimer’s disease in a voice-
over to the extinguishing of lights: one by one the lights in Fiona’s mental space
are switched off. More important, the fact that both Grant and Fiona are not
skiing “along the perfect symmetry of parallel tracks” (Berthin-Scaillet 5) in
these scenes, but moving through space separately, indicates their mental and
emotional change in direction. As a result, the snowy landscape functions not
only as a visual leit­mo­tif for memory but also as a space of transition where the
couple is forced to take on a new perspective on their relationship.
     The final space that will be discussed is the nursing home Meadowlake. The
residential home is divided into two levels: the first floor for patients who can
still live relatively independently, and the second floor for those who are in need
of constant care, who are lost and have “lost it” (Munro 299). It is this space
“where residents transform into patients”: it ironically represents an “opposite
movement” by which people ascend to an upper floor and are removed “from the
public sphere and everyday life” (Adams and Chivers, par. 22). In Polley’s adapta-
tion, Fiona is transferred to the second floor after her condition deteriorates and
220   Katrin Berndt and Jennifer Henke


      thus simul­ta­neously moves to another mental state, namely severe dementia
      paired with de­pres­sion. The film text establishes a clear connection between the
      physical space of the old-age home and the mental space of its residents.
           A particular space of transition manifests itself in one of the large and long
      barrier-free corridors of the nursing home, with its huge windows that let in
      a lot of light. Annmarie Adams and Sally Chivers point out that “[w]ayfinding
      and daylighting” are typical architectural features of institutions such as hospi-
      tals and care homes. The aim of this design is to “diffuse generalizations such
      as ‘old’ and ‘sick’” whereby these buildings “both challenge and reinforce rela-
      tionships among aging, illness, care isolation, and immobility” (pars. 4 and
      5). Adams and Chivers remind us that Polley’s film emphasizes visually what
      “most of us take for granted: that nearly all long-term care settings include
      these special provisions” (par. 6).9 In terms of movement through space, there
      are two noticeable scenes in the movie. First, we see Grant walking away from
      the camera along the well-lit corridor on his own during his first visit after
      the required thirty-day settling-in period, devastated that she has not recog-
      nized him (00:49:24–00:49:41). Second, Fiona also moves away from the film
      audience’s perspective together with Aubrey, pu­shing his wheelchair (01:02:15–
      01:02:38). As a result, the corridor in the care home – the main transitory
      sphere – serves as a meta-space of transition that forces Fiona and Grant to take
      on new perspectives and break out in a new direction, which Polley skilfully
      visualizes on screen. The Meadowlake care home embodies various forms of
      transformation: from home to “home,” from health to illness, from youth to
      age, and from loyalty to disloyalty to loyalty; and, in the couple’s final embrace,
      it also possesses the circular quality of reunion.
           The use of light and colours in these and other scenes ties in nicely with the
      many fades of the film, indicating flashbacks and (the loss of) memories. On
      the morning of Fiona’s departure from their common home, she is displayed in
      a close-up of her face, dressed in a white coat, backlit by soft bright light shining
      in through a window. The lighting, almost resembling a halo, can be read as
      an allusion to Fiona’s innocence and purity, for she always remained faithful
      to Grant (00:30:00–00:30:46). It might also point to the metaphorical lights
      slowly switching off in her mental space as she is about to move to Meadowlake.
      After she gets seriously involved with Aubrey, her clothes occasionally change
      to bright colours, which Grant strongly cri­ti­cizes and calls “tacky.” The use of
      lighting and colours demonstrates the increasing distance between the couple
      on a purely visual level. Moreover, it underlines the “transitory nature of the new
      locale” that Adams and Chivers emphasize (par. 19). In terms of movements
      through space, Grant generally functions as an intruder in the nursing home

      9 | Away from Her was filmed in Kitchener’s Freeport Health Centre, an award-winning
      care institution (Adams and Chivers, par. 17).

most of the time. He interrupts Fiona and Aubrey’s card game in the common
room and also gatecrashes their farewell. Ventura offers a similar reading when
she com­pares Munro’s Meadowlake with Lewis Carroll’s wonderland: “Like the
young Alice, the elderly Grant is an intruder in a territory which is not his and,
like her, he meets unmitigated hostility” (178). In the film version, Grant is
also a stranger in a place that is figuratively and literally Fiona’s new home. As
in Munro’s story, we witness the events and the (new) impressions of the care
home through Grant’s critical eyes. In spite of his doubts about the residence,
“Munro invites readers to recognize and question the assumptions that may
underlie their own perceptions of institutional space” (Jamieson 5; the same
can be said of Polley). This is mainly achieved by depicting a happy elderly
woman who has found new love in old age – Fiona – in large and bright spaces.
    The snowy spaces in Away from Her not only link the human psyche with
the fading away of shared memories but are also associated with ideas of peace,
hope, and rebirth, especially at the end of Polley’s film. Here we see Grant
and Fiona reunited while the camera cir­cles around them, fading into a grainy
close-up of Fiona’s younger self before the image dissolves into the snowy land-
scape with the symmetrical tracks we are fa­mi­liar with from the film’s exposi-
tion (01:40:39 – 01:45:15). This sequence recalls an earlier moment in the mo­v ie
where Fiona and Grant dance together in their living room on the night before
they leave for Meadowlake (00:29:35–00:29:56). The couple’s last dance in their
home is constructed as an intimate and happy rather than a sad and frightening
moment, accentuated by the warm lights but also by the audio space of the
soundtrack, consisting of Neil Young’s song “Harvest Moon,” which unites the
notions of love, age, and care:

   Because I’m still in love with you
   I want to see you dance again
   Because I’m still in love with you
   On this harvest moon.

The characters’ movement through space, their dance, and the soundtrack
create a couple deeply in love or, more precisely, “still in love” with each other,
despite the obstacles they had to face not only during their lengthy marriage
but also during Fiona’s move to the care institution. These semantics are
echoed at the end of the film: in the care home, the camera shoots Grant and
Fiona embracing each other in the same position as in the previous dance scene
in their living room, taking up the same space on screen. In contrast to the
earlier dance sequence, the camera now circles around the two, enhancing
the notion of reunion and everlasting love. The film constructs this scene as a
loving farewell by reversing the movements through space; whereas Grant and
Fiona move in front of a static camera during the dance scene in their country
222   Katrin Berndt and Jennifer Henke


      house, the final sequence operates with a circling camera around a frozen
      couple in the care institution. As a result, this spatial inversion introduces a
      shift in perspective, which is manifested on a cinematographic level: both have
      finally “come over the mountain.” Their relationship has reached an end while
      the camera moves on. After a fade to the familiar parallel skiing tracks, we see
      the younger Fiona in a close-up again, turning her head away from the spec-
      tator, which underscores their farewell. However, the narrative context of the
      film makes clear that both Fiona and Grant have found new partners, namely
      Marian and Aubrey. Thus, the circular movements through space as well as the
      snow imagery equally evoke hope, peace, and a new beginning.
          Polley’s adaptation abounds in spatial imagery, oppositions, and meta­phors
      such as houses, homes, care institutions, cars, beds, cor­­ridors, and snowy land-
      scapes. Against the backdrop of aging, Alzheimer’s disease, and sanity, Herrera
      stresses that “Munro clearly questions the ways in which we tend to draw a neat
      dividing line between sense and non-sense, remembrance and dementia, the
      world of children and the world of seniors” (120). In the context of adaptation,
      McGill adds that the film version of the pre-text “bridges the space between an
      older generation – represented by Munro as well as by Fiona and Grant, … and
      the future of the artistic culture … embodied in young artists such as Polley”
      (“No Nation” 103). Put simply, and expressed in spatial terms, the film not
      only crosses the borders between source text and adaptation but also blurs the
      lines between youth and age, sanity and dementia, and homes and care homes
      by creating a dialogical atmosphere. In fact, McGill describes the movie as a
      demonstration of Polley’s “artistic coming of age” as a Canadian ar­tist (109).
          We wish to conclude this chapter with some lines from another song that
      appears during the credits of Polley’s movie. Canadian icon Neil Young’s
      “Helpless” vividly illustrates the interplay of love and age as well as space and
      (lost) memory in this Canadian film adaptation:

         There is a town in north Ontario,
         With dream comfort and memory to spare,
         And in my mind
         I still need a place to go,
         All my changes were there.

      In this stanza, the words “dream,” “memory,” “mind,” “place,” and “changes”
      are intertwined in a way that reminds us of the challenges that elderly patients
      and also relatives have to face when adapting to new situations such as long-term
      residential care. As we hope our analysis has demonstrated, Alice Munro’s “The
      Bear Came over the Mountain” and Sarah Polley’s Away from Her engage with
      both the anxieties triggered by conventional stories of dementia and care-home
      institutions and the possibility of narrating a new story of love, age, and loyalty.

R ising F og
“I must go in; the fog is rising” – Emily Dickinson

So often I’ve driven, been driven down this road,
I should be used to the nursing home by now.
But this: push open my mother’s door
to find her slumped, a blue sheet tenting her
from head to toe. My touch makes her jump,
she yells, Give my hallucinations back, the ones
the new drug threatens to dispel – Dad has come
to take her home, her dog snuggles in her lap.

I used to do so much, I’m just an empty hole,
a smudge. She thumps the wheelchair’s
arm. Her choice: to scream or weep. She
claws my stroking hand with yellowed nails.
The sheet slides off, bares bruises on her shins –
she’s fallen once again. At last, she calms, picks
at the chocolates I brought her, lets me read
out loud her book. Drifts in and out of sleep.

I have to leave her there. I have to leave.
On the bus on the highway home, haunted
by the vision of her fists clenched tight,
the look she shot me when I stood to go.
Focus on the view: an owl hunched
on a hydro pole, six crows, a kite of geese.
And over the lake: fog. Over the moraine: fog.
Over the rattling pane: fog of ragged breath.
An Enveloping Shadow?
The Role of the Nursing Home in the Social Imaginary
of the Fourth Age

Chris Gilleard and Paul Higgs



In this chapter we consider the nursing home as both a site and a symbol that
fashions the social imaginary of a fourth age. Before exploring the nursing
home’s dual role, we will first outline the concept of a social imaginary, as well
as how the fourth age can be thought of as such a social imaginary. Bearing
in mind this conceptual framework, we go on to address some of the ways in
which the nursing home plays out its critical role in conferring meanings onto
the fourth age, through its organizational culture, its practices of care, and its
own representation in the media. The chapter concludes by considering the
extent to which the fourth age needs to be acknowledged as a powerful and
coherent social representation of much that is feared about later life and how
such representations can be challenged within the nursing home, as well as the
cautions that need to be exercised when mounting such challenges. This latter
point is important in highlighting the tensions that exist in determining what
constitutes “good” care under conditions of compromised agency.



C ollective R epresentations and S ocial I maginaries
Durkheim made the case for distinguishing between what he called “collec-
tive” and “individual” representations. While the latter he considered to lie
within the domain of psychology – the ways in which an individual person
makes conscious sense of his or her world – the former exist outside (exterior
to) individual consciousness and hence form part of the domain of sociology.
The collective understandings of the world are fashioned and reproduced
within society, through social processes that pre-date the individual’s emerging
self, and will continue to be elaborated within the “social thinking” of society
long after the individual has gone. Unlike the sectional interests that have been
230   Chris Gilleard and Paul Higgs


      seen to typify ideology, collective representations serve collective or common
      interests – creating the kind of shared understandings of society and the social
      world that enable successive cohorts to become civic and social beings, inte-
      grated into and able to sustain the society into which they are born and which
      will sustain them as necessarily social beings. Collective representations, in
      effect, enable society to reproduce itself, by representing itself to itself.
          While this way of understanding society through its “collective representa-
      tions” subsequently lost traction in the social sciences, arguably as interest in
      thinking and writing about social thought as “ideology” grew, renewed interest
      in this topic emerged with the work of the social philosopher Cornelius Casto-
      riadis (Thompson). It was particularly in his book The Imaginary Institution of
      Society that Castoriadis developed the concepts of the “social imaginary” and
      “social imaginary institutions” (Imaginary). Social imaginaries, he argued,
      are what give meaning to society and its institutions and in the process help
      fashion those institutions and help them function as social institutions (Imag-
      inary 146). Where Castoriadis’s ideas differed from those of Durkheim was in
      his belief that social imaginaries were not merely the symbolic representation
      of a particular social institution or relationship but rather drew upon a multi-
      plicity (or surplus) of meanings, beyond any singular function or significa-
      tion. This multiplicity of signifiers arises as much from the inherent capacity
      of human beings to create meanings “ex nihilo” as it does from the range of
      symbolic functions that an institution or relationship may at any one time
      possess (Imaginary 343–44, 369). Thus terms like childhood, family, patriotism,
      justice or education generate multiple images, elicit multiple narratives, and are
      embedded within multiple practices that may complement or contradict each
      other. Such social imaginary institutions are both established and undermined
      by a surplus of signifiers, whose superfluity is underwritten by what Castoriadis
      called the “radical imaginary,” that power of imagination and meaning making
      that distinguishes human beings and human society from other, non-human
      species (“The Psyche and Society Anew” 203). It is this “subterranean … flow
      of the radical imaginary” beneath the established social imaginary institutions
      that ensures the essential plurality of societies and of social representations
      (“Philosophy, Politics, Autonomy” 153).



      The F ourth A ge : O ld A ge as a S ocial I maginary
      Old age, we suggest, has long functioned as just such a social imaginary – its
      various sociocultural representations “coexisting, conflictingly” with each
      other (Castoriadis, “The Psyche and Society Anew” 207). Despite claims for
      a universal “aversion to age in humans” (Lowenthal 129), there are neverthe-
      less clear differences in the value attached to “old age” at different times and
                                                           An Enveloping Shadow?       231


different places in history (Minois). Medieval images of wise old men with
flowing beards bent over their books coexisted with other descriptions of old
men whose “shrivelled skin hangs with the hides and flaps with the pelts”
(Gilleard 1073). While a similar degree of ambiguity in portraying older men
can be observed throughout the pre-modern period (Minois), the portrayal of
older women as women has been always less ambiguous and more consistently
negative (Minois 229–32). As Maquerelle, in John Marston’s early Jacobean
drama The Malcontent (1604), complains: for men “[t]he more in years, the
more in perfection the[y] grow,” in contrast to women, for whom, once their
beauty fades it’s “good night with us” for “[t]here cannot be an uglier thing to
see than an old woman” (2.4.57–61).
    Rather less emphasis was placed upon the appearance of age during the
modern period, as the economies of the state shifted toward paid labour and the
ideal was promulgated of the male breadwinner “providing” for the welfare of
his or her family (Clark). The progressive institutionalization of the life course
that was gradually brought about by the welfare reforms initiated in Bismarck’s
Germany in the late nineteenth century and copied throughout Europe and
beyond in the early twentieth increasingly segmented the (male) life course into
three: a period of childhood, shaped by expectations of education, followed by
adulthood, shaped by work, followed by retirement from work and a pensioned
old age, shaped by state and/or corporate pension policies (Anderson). More
recently, the life course has begun to lose some of this normative structure,
with old age ceasing to function as the coherent social category it once was
(Gilleard and Higgs, Contexts). Changes in the cultural and economic under-
pinnings of old age have been accompanied by its evident fracturing. Out of
the “old” social imaginary of old age has emerged a “new” one, which we have
called the social imaginary of the “fourth age” (Gilleard and Higgs, “Aging”;
Higgs and Gilleard, Rethinking). Though its roots can be traced back to much
earlier sociohistorical narratives that distinguished “seniority” from “senility,”
a “green” old age from a “decrepit” one, the novelty of the contemporary imag-
inary has come about from the reimagining of retirement and the emergence
of cultural practices and later lifestyles promoting ideals of active, healthy, and/
or productive ageing – what we have referred to as the cultures of the third age
(Gilleard and Higgs, Cultures; “Third”).



D ementia as S ign and S ignifier
of the F ourth A ge ’s S ocial I maginary

As later life is embraced as a period in one’s life celebrating the “consum-
erist” virtues of choice, autonomy, self-expression, and pleasure, its realization
lies equally in practices designed with one eye on warding off all that might
232   Chris Gilleard and Paul Higgs


      compromise the exercise of such virtues, namely the shadows and the signs
      of dependency, incapacity, suffering, and being unable to exercise one’s choice
      or express one’s voice (Higgs and Gilleard, Rethinking). Integral to this social
      imaginary are narratives of frailty and abjection, of the loss of status and place,
      of agency and identity, and of the need to be cared for (Higgs and Gilleard,
      Personhood). Dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease, provides a powerfully indi-
      vidualized image of what that means. More perhaps than any other condition
      affecting people in later life, Alzheimer’s has come to symbolize all that is most
      terrifying about old age and to serve as the dominant discursive frame for the
      fourth age (Alzheimer’s Research Trust, “Poll”; Cantegreil-Kallen and Pin;
      Cutler; Zeng et al.).
          This effect is further accentuated by the research community, and by
      advocacy organizations such as the Alzheimer’s Society that seek to “raise
      awareness” of the condition in order to expand their role and increase their
      capture of research funding and charitable giving. Between the press releases
      of the research community and the reports of the charitable sector, what has
      been described as an “apocalyptic demography” is constructed that overstates
      the prevalence of the condition and the impact it has upon wider society.
      One recent press release, for example, claimed that as many as one in three
      people would develop Alzheimer’s disease at some point, in effect making it
      as common as such established “killers” as cancer or cardiovascular disease
      (Alzheimer’s Research Trust, “One”). While it is difficult to trace such excessive
      concerns over developing dementia in later life in pre-modern times (Schäfer),
      and while the fear of poverty dominated public concerns over agedness in more
      modern times (Thane 2000), the “Alzheimerization” of aging that became
      evident in the late twentieth century has seen this condition take pole position
      in representing the fear of old age in the twenty-first (Adelman).
          What makes Alzheimer’s so emblematic is the sense that the condition
      (including both Alzheimer’s and related disorders) is not just about rendering
      people forgetful: it represents a malignant forgetfulness that causes people to
      lose their sense of who they are and what is most important to their sense of
      self, in effect to lose their grip on, and their place in, the world. It progres-
      sively weakens people’s connections to society and their access to and use of its
      “collective representations,” as well as their connections to themselves and their
      “individual representations” of their personal past. While clinical researchers
      have sought to qualify the nature and extent of such losses, recognizing the
      large variability among people experiencing these conditions, such empirically
      based caution seems to have had little public impact. Although media repre-
      sentations of Alzheimer’s/dementia have increased greatly since first emerging
      in the 1980s (Kang et al. 691) they have remained mostly negative, displaying
      what Peel has called “a largely absent moral economy of hope” regarding those
      suffering from this condition (897). Almost universally, such representations
                                                          An Enveloping Shadow?      233


emphasize “the catastrophic nature of dementia” and “the horror of the condi-
tion” (Peel 890). News of “breakthroughs” in research represent perhaps the
only example of a significant “counter-framing” discourse, but these stories
must be set against the large number of negative frames that have been
adopted, representing dementia as “confiscating a person’s spirit,” appearing
like “a thief who steals a person’s life”, “synonymous with being condemned to
death” something that can cross the path of any ageing person simply by virtue
of their age, while auguring a return to childhood and childishness (van Gorp
and Vercruysse).
     Given such media coverage, it is hardly surprising that much of what
is nowadays considered most fearful about old age is this prospect of devel-
oping Alzheimer’s/dementia. While old age once threatened – and frequently
realised – a loss of power and status, whether framed in terms of declining
physical attractiveness or prowess or in terms of reduced earning power, such
losses pale into insignificance when set against the widespread fear of losing
not just one’s status but also one’s mind. For most of the nineteenth and much
of the first half of the twentieth century, for most people, old age was a time of
poverty (Thane). The image of the nineteenth-century alms-house (in the United
States) and the workhouse (in Europe) symbolized that threat; once entered,
these institutions were hard to escape from. However, after their introduction,
old-age pensions served as a lifeline for the “aged and impotent,” ensuring that
most could now avoid this fate. During the period of the postwar welfare state,
the majority of these institutions of impoverishment were replaced, in many
cases by more sociable, less intimidating residential-care homes or by long-stay
hostels or hospitals where significant numbers of the more infirm older people
ended their lives. While some combination of infirmity, limited income, and a
serious lack of social capital (in the sense of weak or absent family networks)
still served as the immediate cause of older people’s “institutionalization,” the
majority of ill, infirm, and poor pensioners managed to remain at home, their
suffering invisible to the health and welfare services and the wider public alike
(Williams et al.; Williamson et al.). Dementia, though evidently present, was
just a part of that greater silence, that marginalization of age and infirmity
which, when discovered, led primarily to calls from researchers in the field
for the state to expand its health and welfare services in and to the community
rather than turning back to the earlier solution of building more institutions.
     Following the first “crisis” of the postwar welfare state, during the 1970s,
there was some expansion of “community care,” in the sense of an expansion
of health and welfare services provided to people living at home. At the same
time, the emergence of the “cholinergic hypothesis” research paradigm saw
“senile dementia” upgraded, first becoming “Senile Dementia of the Alzhei-
mer’s Type” (SDAT; see, e.g., Reisberg et al., Summers et al.) and then quickly
being rebranded as “Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders” (ADRD; see,
234   Chris Gilleard and Paul Higgs


      e.g., Eagger et al.). A stirring of public interest in the problem of dementia
      became discernible as a new discourse emerged framing dementia as a public
      health problem – a “rising tide” that sooner or later would need to be addressed
      (Arie and Jolley; Health Advisory Service). Subsequently, funding began for
      research into the problem of “caregiver burden,” effectively extending interest
      in dementia as a problem not just for individual older people but also for their
      families, including their adult, working-age children. By the mid-1980s. novel
      drug trials were being initiated of various potential “anti-dementia” medica-
      tions (Chatellier and Lacomblez; Eagger et al.; Summers et al.). Since these
      invariably enlisted the support of carers to complement the clinician’s assess-
      ments, with ratings based on the person’s “behavioural functioning” or general
      “dependency,” these two developments proceeded with a kind of synergy, as
      carers’ and researchers’ reports of dramatic improvements in patients’ mental
      functioning began making headline news (see, e.g., Nelson; “Drug”; “New”).
          The combination of disease-modifying treatments, new “intermediate,”
      semi-institutional settings for care, and enhanced “community-care manage-
      ment” were trialled with the hope that some combination of care and treat-
      ment might “prevent” institutionalization. By the time the twentieth century
      was reaching its end, the prospect of drugs to treat dementia, community-care
      services to keep people with dementia at home, and a range of “psychosocial”
      interventions that promised to preserve the personhood of people with dementia
      (Bourgeois et al.; Mittelman et al.) had the cumulative effect of making institu-
      tionalization – that is, entry into a nursing home or other residential care – even
      more a mark of failure than it had been before. Set against these bright lights of
      hope, the shadows in the background were darkening.



      The N ursing H ome as S ign and S ignifier
      of the F ourth A ge ’s S ocial I maginary

      This optimism was retained for a short time into the twenty-first century. It
      was soon becoming clear that these solutions were nowhere near as credible
      as they had once seemed. Day care and respite services were cut back, anti-de-
      mentia drug trials petered out, and psychosocial interventions were increas-
      ingly targeted toward people who were not “aging in place” but dementing in
      nursing homes (AD 2000 Collaborative Group; Cabrera et al.; Cooper et al.;
      Schneider et al.). Trends in long-term care (LTC), in developed economies at
      least, indicated that community services were being increasingly stretched to
      meet the needs of older people to age in place. As the threshold for receiving
      help rose, nursing homes were having to deal with a growing intensity of need
      among their residents (Meijer et al.; Gori et al.; Ranci and Pavolini). Confusion,
      incontinence, and immobility exemplified the chronic conditions affecting an
                                                           An Enveloping Shadow?      235


increasing majority of nursing-home residents, as the nursing home became
the endpoint when the drugs had failed, the day centres were no longer able to
support the families, and no other sources of respite were left beyond that of the
institution (van den Brink et al.).
     In the new millennium, dementia and the nursing home have become
indissoluble entities, the latter the institutional location where the former
reaches its ultimate form. They serve as the collective representation of the
fourth age, signifiers of the failure to age well, to age mindfully, and to sustain
the practices of self-care. Within the nursing home, the daily round can seem
a continual challenge to hold at bay, for as long and as much as possible, the
ultimate abjections of the fourth age. It is a challenge not confined to main-
taining what has been called the “personhood” of the residents suffering from
dementia and related disorders; it is equally a challenge for staff to maintain
their own personhood in the face of constant threats to their own moral identity
as carers. Care workers who face the daily task of doing the dirty work of care
must do so without succumbing to its potentially contaminating influences –
contaminating their bodies, their feelings, and their sensibilities (Sandvoll et
al.). It is this dual process of resisting the penetration of the social imaginary
of the fourth age into the lives and experiences of those who live and those who
work in the nursing home that is addressed in the final section of this chapter.



R esistance and R esignation in the F ace of the F ourth A ge
In the twenty-first century, developing dementia is one of the most powerful
predictors of who will and who will not enter a nursing home (Houttekier et al.;
Luppa et al.). It is also one of the few conditions that would induce the majority
of adults to at least contemplate moving in future into a nursing home (Werner
and Segel-Karpas). The nursing home, more than any other social institution,
realizes the social imaginary of the fourth age within contemporary society.
As with dementia, “the popular press focuses on nursing homes as contempo-
rary ‘gulags,’ sites of increasing use of chemical restraints, places of abuse and
violence, and locations of tragedies that reveal high levels of neglect” (Chivers
134–35), casting what Gubrium and Holstein have termed “an interpretive
shadow on meaning” over the frail bodies and failing minds of its residents
(521). Yet nursing homes remain on the periphery of society’s vision, as much
as the alms-house or the workhouse were over a century ago. They are brought
into the public gaze, it seems, only when a scandal breaks out or a company
collapses (Lloyd et al.). Although nursing homes are a real presence in the
lives of many more people than just the staff and the residents (because of the
involvement of families – both as occasional or regular visitors, and as proxy
clients looking into the acceptability of a home for their relative, partner or
236   Chris Gilleard and Paul Higgs


      friend), the public’s experience and understanding of the nursing home seem
      to arise more from media news stories portraying these institutions in a frankly
      negative or less often neutral light (Miller et al.).
           It is a curious paradox that while abuse, indignity, and scandal provide the
      main focus of media attention on the nursing home, these darker aspects of
      care feature least prominently in what could be called the “professional litera-
      ture on care work.” Ever since Everett Hughes introduced the term “dirty work”
      to refer to the degrading, undignified or immoral aspects of work performed
      by various occupational groups, it has become common to refer to certain occu-
      pations, including that of the nursing-home care worker, as pervasively dirty,
      because of workers’ continual contact with physical, moral, or socially tainted
      “dirt” (Ashforth and Kreiner, “How”; “Dirty”). What helps define dirty work
      is its capacity to taint – and hence to marginalize and render abject those who
      perform such tasks. Given these threats to dirty workers’ self-regard, it has
      been argued that in response there is a greater likelihood that “a strong occupa-
      tional or workgroup culture will emerge to counter that threat” (Ashforth and
      Kreiner, “How” 431). One consequence is that the more troubling aspects of the
      work tend to be excluded from discussion, and instead the work is reframed
      as a “morally valuable” service, recalibrated as “a necessity shield” or retold
      through “rites of initiation” as a marker of emotional moral or physical strength
      (Ashforth and Kreiner, “Dirty”).
           In the process, the hurt, indignity, and suffering of both residents and
      workers may be minimized and the emotional damage denied, repressed, or
      reattributed to the residents’ neglect by their families. Tensions between staff
      and family are not uncommon, as the guilt experienced by family members
      who feel they have failed to look after their relative long enough or well enough
      is displaced onto the perceived failings of the staff in carrying out their duties,
      who in turn resent the (c)overt hostility of relatives (Bauer). Complaints
      may arise that staff neglect residents (such as losing items of their relatives’
      clothing), that they do not give residents enough time (to eat, to get dressed
      or to find their way to the toilet), or that they are inattentive to their needs
      (responding slowly or not at all to calls for help, or failing to prevent episodes
      of incontinence). In turn, staff may feel simmering resentment toward these
      criticisms, secretly harbouring the belief that the relatives are the ones who
      have failed or “given up” too easily on their dependent while having little under-
      standing of the pressure that they, the staff, are under looking after so many
      mentally and physically frail residents (Abrahamson et al.).
           Thus the abjection and the failure that shape the social imaginary of the
      fourth age within the nursing home envelop not just the residents but relatives
      and staff as well, leaving each group of stakeholders depressed, demoralized,
      and dissatisfied. The moral imperative to care that is shared by all concerned
      is continually confronted by residents who often do not wish to be cared for –
                                                           An Enveloping Shadow?      237


whether because they are angered or agitated by the unwanted intrusion it
involves, or because they fail to recognize the identity or intentions of those
doing the caring (Hoeffer et al.). It is one thing to help those who either recog-
nize their helplessness (such as people with severe physical disabilities) or
whose have no prior experience of autonomy or independence (such as infants
or people with developmental disabilities), where the moral imperative of care-
giving is realized through mutuality and (asymmetric) reciprocity; it is another
when neither mutuality nor reciprocity can be realized. While it would be a
gross exaggeration to confine examples of the latter to people with dementia, it
is still the case that most examples of “conflicted caregiving” are linked to this
condition, making care of older people with dementia the setting for further
abjection and ignominy (Higgs and Gilleard, “Frailty”).



C are and its U nintended C onsequences
It would be misrepresenting the nursing home if it were seen as little other than
a site of mutual abjection, and it would be misrepresenting nursing-home staff
if they were seen as engaging in little more than reframing their experience
and practices in ways to safeguard their self-esteem in the face of doing a dirty
and demoralizing job. There are many examples of staff and residents forming
open, caring relationships characterized by mutual feelings of attachment
(Costigan; Wilson et al.). For many staff, the dominant frame for their work is
that of “family” (Dodson and Zincavage). But even when care is given within
such a framework, there exists the possibility that caregiving itself undermines
the autonomy and compromises the identity of the resident, while staff who
are less engaged with the residents may paradoxically strengthen the collective
agency of the residents by causing them to come to each other’s aid (Ryvicker).
These and many other contradictions of care are embedded within the orga-
nizational culture of the nursing home. Work done to resist the prospect of a
social death and protect residents against the shadows of a fourth age may risk
demanding too much or alternatively infantilizing them (Gilleard and Higgs,
“Social”) A too intense focus on delivering comprehensive physical care may
minimise the indignities of pain and suffering, while quietly nursing residents
into a kind of social death. Offers of aid and assistance to keep residents “digni-
fied” (like bathing, showering, and toileting) may elicit only aggression as such
aid is perceived as intrusive, unwanted, and threatening to an already vulner-
able person (Gates et al.).
    The nursing home itself produces multiple meanings by which both staff
and residents can be represented. It may be represented through a number of
different frames, ranging from a “home from home” to a biomedical “skilled
nursing” facility through to a necessary institution to prevent the abjection of
238   Chris Gilleard and Paul Higgs


      extreme agedness from leaking into the public sphere (Nakrem). Foucauldian
      narratives can be employed to represent the nursing home as part of
      modern-day “bio-politics,” controlling the unruly bodies of the uncivilized old
      (Hyde et al.), but such seemingly radical perspectives leave unaddressed what
      most families want for their frail, aged relatives: a safe and dignified life as
      free from suffering as possible. Creating a setting where that is possible neces-
      sarily sets in motion practices and procedures that involve an asymmetrical
      set of relationships between carers and those being cared for. This asymmetry
      is a function of both relational and representational power, operating at the
      level of what Foucault has called the agonisms of freedom, as much as through
      systems of governance. What this amounts to is staff who both are more able
      to look after the residents than the residents themselves and also have more
      power to represent and enact the “reality of care” than do the residents (more so
      in those “units” where most residents suffer from dementia and related mental
      infirmities). While it could be argued that the nursing home itself – the insti-
      tutional matrix determined by the commissioning authority and the provider
      organization – operates its own separate systems of power, through its regimes
      of corporate governance, regulating the conduct of staff and residents alike, this
      overarching regulatory structure may add to, as much as it ensures against,
      enveloping the residents within the shadows of a fourth-age imaginary.
          Paradoxes of care abound within the interstices of power that permeate the
      nursing home. Since the residents mostly lack power to resist the institutional
      systems of governance of the nursing home (and arguably have entered the
      nursing home precisely for that reason), their agency is likely to be exercised
      more in the daily agonisms of freedom that constitute the interactions between
      staff and residents, and between the residents themselves. While the former
      are marked by the asymmetry of power noted above, the latter are least affected
      by such asymmetries. Does that mean that here at least, in resident-to-resi-
      dent interactions, lie the best chances for sustaining one’s agency, representing
      one’s identity, and establishing one’s place in the social world? Perhaps not.
      Perhaps such possibilities become less realizable because most residents have
      lost their power to form, maintain, and adapt their social relationships to
      others, especially others who share the same weakness. While the aged poor
      in the Victorian workhouses were able to and did write letters of complaint
      about the conditions in the wards or the infirmary, few residents of today’s
      nursing homes have the means to do so – not because of poverty, not because
      of a lack of education, not even because of a lack of social capital, but because
      of their own mental infirmity: their inability to represent themselves in and
      to the social.
                                                           An Enveloping Shadow?      239


C onclusions
The nursing home has long been portrayed in a negative light, as an oppres-
sive institution, prone to scandalous practices and serving as an antechamber
to the grave. As the residents of these institutions have become more prone
to physical and mental infirmity, and as the care offered by these institutions
has intensified, the power of staff and residents has consequently become
weaker in resisting these institutions’ “interpretive power” to confer upon
old age the imaginary of a fourth age. The direct experience of life within the
nursing home remains confined to a small group of people: the residents, who
are increasingly mentally and physically frail, and the staff, who are increas-
ingly drawn from the poorer and more marginal groups within the workforce.
Consequently, the nursing home’s collective representation relies heavily upon
reports in the media. Since media attention is strongly influenced by issues of
newsworthiness, it is hardly surprising that abuse, scandal, and poor standards
of care dominate the framing of the nursing home. It is in this sense that we
have argued in this chapter that the nursing home acts as a potent signifier of
the fourth age and what it represents: society’s greatest fears of old age.
    Resistance to that imaginary is difficult to mount and even more difficult to
sustain, not least because it is mediated through the frames of the news media,
rather than constrained within the everyday practices of the staff or its visitors.
Further, the densification of disability that has taken place over the last two
decades means that the residents are less and less able to position themselves
as dissatisfied customers or discontented citizens – in the way that the aged
residents of the old workhouses or alms-houses once were. Who can provide the
“counter-frames” against such representations, and how? Arguably, the research
community, rather than serving such a function, only adds to it by critiquing
standards of care, particularly by identifying care practices as contributing to,
rather than preventing, a malignant social psychology that makes the residents
more demented than they would otherwise be. While such critiques are no
doubt motivated by the desire to “do something,” to improve the quality of life
of the residents – in short to defend them from being engulfed by the shadows
of the fourth age – the evidence of their success in so doing remains limited at
the very least (Beerens et al.; Olsen et al.).
    Caught by what we have called “the moral imperative of care” (Higgs and
Gilleard, Personhood), it can seem that staff working in the care sector are
assailed on all sides by a morally ambiguous task, namely to treat the people
they care for in ways that depend upon a narrative that their daily experience
either confounds or frankly contradicts. Work that is carried out itself under a
shadow – the shadow of “dirty work” – requires care workers to manage their
own feelings of disgust and indignity while maintaining a semblance of their
own and their residents’ sense of worth and dignity. The general lack of signs
240   Chris Gilleard and Paul Higgs


      of moral worth assigned to their work and to their place of work (demonstrated,
      in pre-modern times, by the religious nature of their calling and their place of
      work) goes back to the poor laws. While early-twentieth-century reforms saw
      hospitals and hospital nursing rise in standing as nursing became professional-
      ized and increasingly allied with medicine, the workhouses and alms-houses –
      and now nursing homes – are staffed predominantly by non-professionalized
      hourly-paid labour: the legacy of the pauper nurse and the workhouse maid.
          To achieve change, to strengthen the capacity of staff and residents to resist
      the shadows of the fourth age, requires more resources to combat the devaluing
      of the work, the marginalization of the workplace, and the spectacular nature
      of the care environment, where visitors are encouraged as much as to observe
      as to share in the quality of care. More specific responses can be suggested,
      from the creation of university-affiliated nursing homes to the development of
      shared citizenship in the running and shared ownership in the management
      of the nursing home itself, with government or local-authority incentivization
      of such collective systems by staff, relatives, and those residents most able and
      willing to contribute. Achieving any kind of cultural change in nursing homes
      is difficult (Shier et al.). The Green House model1 represents a definite step
      toward implementing this agenda, for example, although even this has proved
      difficult to implement consistently (Zimmerman et al.). So long as the nursing
      home remains both a symbol and a structure that realizes the social imaginary
      of the fourth age, it will continue to be the site where the struggle to resist that
      imaginary is most acute and most challenging. Rather than hiding from the
      uncomfortable contradictions of later life by segregating a space for the fourth
      age within the nursing home, the opening out of this struggle is important,
      even if – or most likely because – its resolution is so hard to realize.

Old Age, Life Narrative and Self-Presentation in the Novel
The Real Captain’s Sea by Zvonko Todorovski

In the article “The Retirement Home, Alive with Intrigue,” written on the
occasion of the publication of Jill McCorkle’s novel Life After Life (2013), Paula
Span notes that in recent years the topic of aging has become more visible in
popular culture, with “senior communities, nursing homes and assisted living
facilities playing a variety of roles.” Since the middle of the last century, the
organization of seniors’ and nursing homes, as well as the daily lives of their
residents and employees, has become the subject of numerous influential
anthropological and sociological studies. Some of these studies have revealed
extremely poor living conditions in these institutions (Gubrium xiv; see Zeman
and Geiger Zeman 74). Research based on ethnography and qualitative meth-
odology often refers to the well-known concept of “total institutions” devel-
oped by Erving Goffman. The interpretative paradigm developed by Berger
and Luckmann and inspired by symbolic interactionism is very useful for our
analysis, as is the “dramaturgical” approach of Goffman himself. These authors
inspired anthropologist Rene Somera, who in the 1980s carried out ethno-
graphic research in a Philippine “home for the aged, an institution designed for
elderly living” (1). We fully accept Somera’s statement that this kind of institu-
tion is a physical and social space that can be analyzed in terms of geographical,
physical, and social categories (Somera 9; see Zeman and Geiger Zeman 74, 75).
A home for older and infirm persons is an extremely interesting, multi-coded
institution that is always located in a real, physical, and geographical locality,
yet it has a complex, multilayered meaning for those who live in it as well as for
their families, for its employees, and for society at large. Stephen Katz argues
248   Marija Geiger Zeman, Zdenko Zeman, and Mirela Holy


      that the “nursing home” is “a micro-complex of architectural, administrative,
      financial, clinical, familial, symbolic, and emotional interactions and power
      relations” (204).
          The plot of the 2008 novel The Real Captain’s Sea (More pravog kapetana)
      by Croatian writer Zvonko Todorovski (1960–2010) centres on a home (here-
      after “the Home”) for older and infirm persons in Varaždin (see Somera 1997),1
      a medium-sized town in northwestern Croatia.2 From his description of the
      Home, it is evident that Todorovski was very familiar with public institutions for
      older people in Croatia, and especially with their architectural design, interior
      design, and spatial layout – that is, with their “physical setting” (Somera 61).
      The interior of the Home suggests pleasant, almost hotel-like accommodation:
      a spacious lobby with a reception desk, a large “horseshoe-shaped” bar and “club
      seating,” a “glazed lounge” reminiscent of a conservatory, a smaller room with
      an outdated TV and comfortable armchairs, and a pleasant restaurant domi-
      nated by warm colors and serving delicious food (even catering for the nutri-
      tional preferences of the guests; there are, for example, dishes for diabetics and
      vegetarians) (Todorovski 18, 20, 29).3 A corridor to the left of the entrance leads
      to the office units, while the upper floors house both single and double rooms for
      residents, which can be reached by an elevator or stairs. There is a small kitchen
      on each floor where residents can prepare hot drinks and meals (Todorovski
      29). It is important to note that residents can arrange their rooms according to
      their wishes. Thus, for example, the room occupied by the male protagonist,
      Franko Perić, is lined by bookshelves and so resembles a library (Todorovski
      46). In addition, each room has a balcony where residents can grow flowers, and
      they can also enjoy the lawn and trees behind the building (Todorovski 29, 45).
          The overwhelmingly pleasant interior design convincingly refutes the
      widespread belief (held by Franko himself) that homes for older and infirm

      1 | Institutions specialized in the provision of care to older and disabled people in
      Croatia are called “homes for older and infirm persons.” These institutions provide
      half-day and full-day care services and also offer help or care to older persons at their
      private homes (Šostar and Fortuna 40; translated by Barbara Katić). In the case of
      full-day care, residents receive complete services that include permanent “accommo-
      dation, food, personal hygiene mainteinance, health care,” organized work activities
      and opportunities for the active “use of free time” (40). Almost every such institution
      accommodates older persons in a residential area (similar to a hotel) and runs an inten-
      sive care unit that resembles a hospital facility. The story in the novel analyzed here
      takes place in the residential area of the home for older and infirm persons.

persons are “dark,” desolate, and sad places (Todorovski 19). In Croatia, where
such institutions are frequently equated with public housing for the poor, a
very gloomy image of homes for senior citizens has dominated for a long time
(Geiger Zeman et al.). The family is traditionally regarded as the primary care
provider for its older members, and moving to a home for older and infirm
persons was considered a disgrace for both the older person involved and for
his or her family members, especially the children. However, social, economic,
and cultural changes as well as changes in relationships within the family have
gradually led to shifts in perceptions and attitudes toward homes for older and
infirm persons. Today, more and more older people decide to move into an
institution of this type (Geiger Zeman et al.), resulting in excessive demand,
especially in the larger cities where accommodation facilities are insufficient.
For this reason, in the capital of Zagreb, ten-year waiting periods for single
or double rooms in certain institutions are not unusual (Geiger Zeman et
al.; Žganec et al. 182). In The Real Captain’s Sea, both Franko (whose sister
Lucija helped him obtain the accommodation in Varaždin) and Slavica Pavletić,
Franko’s friend and the female protagonist, face this problem.
     In this context, the question about the relationship between society/social
reality and art, specifically literary work, arises. From the position of the “reflec-
tion approach,” art (“fine,” popular, folk, etc.) “contains information about
society” or “tells us something about society” (Alexander 21). On the other side,
the “shaping approach” or “shaping theories” are based on the idea that “art can
somehow put ideas into people’s heads” or that “art has an impact on society”
(Alexander 41). Both approaches show that links between society and art (or
a specific literary work) are not linear and simple but multilayered, complex,
and dialectical (Alexander 33). Any work of art (novel, film, painting, music
video, etc.), as a “cultural product” (or cultural text), “reflects and shapes the
social world in which we live” (Sutherland and Feltey vii). Sociological reading/
watching of literary or cinematic fiction includes detecting, identifying, and
analyzing “social experiences, institutions, and the theoretical perspectives
within them” (Sutherland and Feltey xi). This argument is in perfect harmony
with the statement of the famous American sociologist Lewis A. Coser, as
presented in the book Sociology through Literature (1972):4

Nothing human ought to be alien to the social scientist; if a novel, a play or a poem
is a personal and direct impression of social life, the sociologist should respond to it
with the same openness and willingness to learn that he displays when he interviews a
respondent, observes a community, or classifies and analyzes survey data. (xvi)

      In this chapter, we turn to a novel that offers “a personal and direct impres-
      sion” of an extremely important aspect of contemporary social life that we have
      studied in homes for older and infirm persons in Croatia using qualitative
      methods (in-depth interviews, participant observations, focus groups, etc.). In
      The Real Captain’s Sea, Todorovski skilfully combines elements of fiction with
      descriptions of the specific social, cultural, and economic contexts in which
      older people live in Croatia, organize their lives, and spend old age in institu-
      tional settings. This novel is thus very useful for reading through a sociological
      lens.
          The basic prerequisite for the successful adaptation of older persons to a
      new and institutional environment is their autonomy to make decisions and
      their free will to move to a home for older and infirm persons (Geiger Zeman
      et al.). In the novel, Franko and Slavica, like their friends Professor Bučić and
      Doctor Lipovac, come to the Home in Varaždin voluntarily. Although readers
      do not learn about the factors that motivated Bučić and Lipovac, it is evident
      that Franko and Slavica each had different reasons for moving to the home.
          The main reasons behind Slavica’s arrival at the Home were intergenera-
      tional misunderstandings and disharmonious relationships within her imme-
      diate family. Unlike Franko, who has no children, Slavica is the mother of
      two adult married sons, Dalibor and Vladimir, who take care of her “as much
      as they can” and help her financially (Todorovski 74). However, she does not
      consider living together with them and their families to be a viable long-term
      option (Todorovski 74). Until now, Slavica has spent her life in Vinkovci, a small
      town in eastern Croatia. As her house was devastated during the Homeland
      War (1991–95), she lived with her son Dalibor for some time. The situation
      was bearable while her grandchildren were small and she was taking care of
      them, but as they grew older she began to feel that she was a burden in the
      small apartment where they all lived, and the relationship with Dalibor’s wife
      was far from harmonious (Todorovski 75). She then went to stay with Vladimir,
      but since the situation there was even worse, she decided to move to a home for
      older and infirm persons until her house was rebuilt. Due to very long waiting
      times for a place in a home for older persons in the nearby town of Osijek, she
      came to Varaždin, where she was able to obtain a single room after only two
      months (Todorovski 75). Her new home accommodates people whose “children
      do not want to live with [them] anymore” as well as those left alone (Todorovski
      57). The novel does not discuss the reasons behind people’s arrival at the Home;
      the important thing is that the novel’s characters are fully aware of the fact that
      some of the Home’s residents have good pensions or are financially supported
      by children and/or grandchildren (Todorovski 19, 20), allowing them to stay in
      this institution and easing their lives there.
          Chronological age as a dividing line between youth and old age is reflected
      in the spatial settings of the novel: some of the locations are determined by
                                     A New Home, A New Beginning, A New Identity      251


the age structure of their permanent and occasional users and visitors. For
example, the café in the center of town is described as a space dominated by
young people, while the Home appears as its opposite. It is an institution, a
place intended for people aged over 65; Todorovski describes it as a kind of
“island” that is actually “only a seemingly isolated place because it could be
reached as well as any other place in town whenever one wished” (45). However,
the Home is a segregated locality where older people are separated from the
younger and where the physical accessibility of the residents does not annul a
certain existential discontinuity between them and the rest of the world (Stone
63). As an institution determined primarily by the age of its residents, the home
for older and infirm persons produces common images that reflect different
age stereotypes; this is evident even in the official name of such institutions.
As mentioned above, in Croatia this type of institution is officially called a
“home for older and infirm persons.” The name implies that old age and infir-
mity – and in Slavica’s opinion, also solitude – are “the core of powerlessness”
(Todorovski 21). They are inextricably linked and mutually conditioned. The
noun infirmity is often defined as a mental or physical failing or weakness,
and it is frequently erroneously associated with older age alone.5 Therefore,
the very name of the institution permanently confirms this stereotype and the
unfounded “commonsense” belief of the mutual conditionality of old age and
disability (Stone 62, 63).
    If we focus on the social aspects of everyday life in the home for older and
infirm persons, it is evident that many people are involved – from residents to
employees and visitors (for example, family, volunteers, students, and so on)
(Somera 74). Todorovski deals mainly with the relationships and social inter-
action of the residents, primarily Franko and Slavica, giving only fleeting and
partial information about the other types of relationships inside the Home,
but even these few episodes provide a deeper insight into the network of social
relations within this micro-social universe. As in every institution, the people
interacting there are of different backgrounds and have diverse experiences
and lifestyles, while their relationships and daily lives are guided by certain
formal rules laid down by the Home. However, it is clear that some of these
rules are not consistently enforced; indeed, their non-compliance is tacitly toler-
ated (for example, although smoking is prohibited, some residents still smoke)
(Todorovski 105). Another important aspect of life in the Home is routine
(Geiger Zeman et al). In fact, as Berger and Luckmann observe, “all human
activity is subject to habitualization” (70), since activities that we frequently
repeat form patterns that can be reproduced with little effort, liberating us
from the burden of choice and thus bringing psychological relief (70, 71). It is
important to point out that routine and the predictability of life in the Home, as

252   Marija Geiger Zeman, Zdenko Zeman, and Mirela Holy


      is emphasized by Todorovski, should not be understood as the performance of
      actions that have lost sense for the individual. As Berger and Luckmann clarify,
      “habitualized actions” have meaning for individuals, yet their significance is
      not constantly redefined anew but is rather “taken for granted” (71). Todorovski
      points out that along with the formal, externally imposed rules of the Home,
      life there is also managed by old age as the supreme master whose laws and
      regulations the residents must obey (73). Age and youth, past and present, are
      themes that pervade Franko’s and Slavica’s everyday conversations and lead us
      into the social subworlds and friendship networks that exist within the social
      reality of the Home, also revealing an intriguing aspect of their interpersonal
      relationship.



      Past and P resent as Youth and O ld A ge
      In their daily communication and life narratives, Franko and Slavica discuss,
      among other things, universal human themes, the past and present, old age
      and youth, truth and lies, authentic and inauthentic life, and friendship. The
      novel is interesting primarily because it reflects these important philosophical
      (for example, transience of life), anthropological (for example, identity issues
      and the narrative dimension of identity), sociological (for example, the orga-
      nization of institutional care for older persons, friendship, and social relations
      within an institutional context), and gerontological (for example daily routines
      of older persons) topics, demonstrating their deeprootedness in the context of
      personal biographies and the broader sociocultural framework in which the
      protagonists are embedded.
          These themes of youth, old age, and the transience of life are present in
      Slavica’s and Franko’s recollections of people in the past as well as in their inter-
      pretations based on idealized images of youth. This indicates two important
      things: first, youth and old age are constructed categories imbued with
      different meanings, and second, individual interpretations of youth and old
      age are rooted in everyday and commonsense knowledge, which often implies
      and supports age-related stereotypes and reductive collective narratives. This
      helps to maintain “the binary opposition of ‘young’ and ‘old’” (Kriebernegg and
      Maierhofer, “Ages” 9). Slavica’s perception of old age is not static. At first, she is
      predominantly negative and pessimistic, caught in a narrative of “loss” (Baars
      106, 107) and “human decline” (Wangler 114) rooted in her personal biography
      and the lived experience of sacrifice, loss, personal unfulfillment, and dissat-
      isfaction with both her current and her previous life. From her contemporary
      viewpoint, the past was pleasant and good, though it did not seem so at the
      time. Resigned and disappointed, she no longer wants or expects anything
      from life. She believes that old age is “a time when there is no more present”
                                     A New Home, A New Beginning, A New Identity       253


(Todorovski 21) and when the only things left are memories of the “good old
days.”
     Franko’s position and his interpretation of old age are more complex and
ambivalent because they are composed of elements that suggest an under-
standing of “aging as a dialectic of loss and gain” (Baars 106). To Franko, old
age is a time for a “new beginning” (Wangler 115) or “a positive opportunity to
embark on a new life” (Grebe et al. 89). Released from numerous restrictions
and previous responsibilities, he now has the opportunity to occupy himself
with self-realization and the realization of many of his previous aspirations. He
responds to Slavica’s (age) pessimism with a positive image of “old age as supe-
riority” (Wangler 115), that is, a time marked by maturity and wisdom (Todor-
ovski 21). On another occasion, Franko, in conversation with Doctor Lipovac
(after it is revealed that Professor Bučić actually holds a PhD in physics), defines
old age as a period in which interests and priorities are changing (for example,
titles and status are no longer so important) (Todorovski 64). Nevertheless,
though he would no longer want to be a young man of 20, a story about events
lived in the past is a reminder of youth, good times, and “the good old days”:
“Youth is a damn beast. And what is worst, the older you get, the more beautiful
it seems” (Todorovski 54). Alongside youth and old age, the important reference
points around which the story develops are the complementary coordinates of
past and present. For Franko, his change of residence opens the opportunity to
view his past from the present position of his older years.



The B rief H istory of a F riendship
Friends occupy an important place in the lives of people of different ages. Specific
forms of interpersonal relations have different meanings for individuals, and
in academic literature, there are various definitions and diverse approaches to
the study of social relationships of this type. Precisely these insights suggest
that the category of friendship is very wide and flexible. Scholars distinguish
between different types of friendship, for example, “simple friendship” (“asso-
ciate, useful contact, favour friend, fun friend”) and “complex friendship”
(“helpmate, comforter, confidant, soulmate”) (Spencer and Pahl 60). According
to Graham Allan, “normative definitions of friendship” highlight some of the
crucial features of this relationship: egalitarianism, reciprocity, and symmetry
(qtd. in Policarpo 174). Thus friendship is determined primarily as “person-ori-
ented” and bringing “intimacy and enjoyment” to all parties involved (Poli-
carpo 173). In the broadest sense, friendship pertains to informal relationships
between people who visit each other, spend time together, discuss (usually
personal) issues important to them, consult or support each other mutually or
even materially (Claude S. Fischer, qtd. in Policarpo 172; Spencer and Pahl 59).
254   Marija Geiger Zeman, Zdenko Zeman, and Mirela Holy


      In a narrow sense, friendship involves “closeness and intimacy” (Malcolm R.
      Parks and Kory H. Floyd, qtd. in Policarpo 172). Of course, these two qualities of
      friendship are complex. “Closeness” covers a wide range of “emotional, cogni-
      tive” and even physical intimacy (Policarpo 172), while “intimacy” involves
      “self-disclosure, emotional expressiveness, unconditional support, physical
      contact, trust, (sharing) activities and sexual contact” (Michael Monsour, qtd. in
      Policarpo 172). Real friendship relations, of course, deviate from this somewhat
      idealized definition. Liz Spencer and Ray Pahl define friendship as a kind of
      “personal community” with different forms (32) and functions for the people
      involved. In their study, they offer an answer to the seemingly simple question,
      “What is a friend?,” establishing that friendship is a relationship with a specific
      quality: it is chosen between persons “who have something in common” (for
      example, “the same sense of humour or similar interests,” place of residence,
      lifestyle, etc.); these individuals “enjoy each other’s company,” visit each other,
      go out, communicate directly or indirectly (by mobile phone, telephone, email,
      social networks, etc.) or perform certain activities together (for example, exer-
      cising, walking, painting, learning foreign languages); they give each other
      practical and “emotional support,” feel comfortable together, confide in each
      other, and feel a mutual obligation to one another (Spencer and Pahl 34, 59).
           Like life itself, friendship is not a static form. It is, rather, a procedural,
      fluid, and changing relationship. In this respect, Spencer and Pahl talk about
      “friendship career” or the “history of friendship, that … can follow a number of
      different” and unpredictable “trajectories” (72). Franko and Slavica’s friendly
      relationship undoubtedly falls into the category of “complex friendship”
      (Spencer and Pahl 60) and can be traced through three basic stages: the estab-
      lishment, termination, and restoration of the relationship.
           Friends are “chosen because of the need to reflect our own image in the
      other. Friends are perfect mirrors of ourselves” (Todorovski 57). Slavica and
      Franko’s friendship commences with Franko’s arrival at the Home and their
      encounter at lunch in the Home’s restaurant. Their friendship is triggered by
      a very simple fact: Slavica is thrilled by the sea, although she has never seen
      it, while Franko comes from Split – a town on the Adriatic coast – and intro-
      duces himself as a retired sea captain (Todorovski 25). In this way, “one side
      could easily give what it had in abundance, something the other side was so
      painfully lacking” (Todorovski 27). Slavica, when she first sets eyes on Franko,
      imagines that he has spent his working life as a bank director or senior bank
      official (Todorovski 34). The fact that friendship indeeds plays an important
      role in the lives of older persons is underlined by the effect of this friendship on
      Slavica who, before Franko’s arrival, spent her days in the Home in predictable
      monotony. During this time, she did not establish a close relationship with any
      resident. Her contacts amounted to polite greetings, participation in organized
      parties (at which she pretended she was having a good time), and reading, “the
                                       A New Home, A New Beginning, A New Identity         255


only true entertainment” (Todorovski 20). It is precisely the arrival of Captain
Franko that transforms Slavica from someone locked in a constant struggle
with her memories into an enthusiastic and cheerful person. Her friendship
with Captain Franko and his stories of ships and distant voyages allow her to
compensate for the frustration caused by her being unable to realize her lifelong
dreams: to visit the coast, enjoy the sea, and travel to distant countries. She
believes that through her meetings with Captain Franko she will accomplish
all that she has ever dreamed of (Todorovski 30). Moreover, sometimes while
listening to his adventures she feels a “friendly envy” because she would like
to have similar stories to tell (Todorovski 41). However, the friendship is based
on the fact that Captain Franko is her opposite: “His experience transcended
the majority of the books she had read. She admired the wisdom derived from
real life, and Franko was just such a man. His outlooks were shaped by expe-
rience unattainable to her” (Todorovski 38). Slavica and Captain Franko are
different in several respects, making evident that their characterization is
linear and based on traditional binary gender divisions and double gender stan-
dards. Franko’s appearance corresponds to the stereotype of the charming and
physically handsome older man: gray hair, blue eyes, a flat stomach. A blue
captain’s uniform with golden buttons and golden-brown braids on its sleeves
contributes further to his charm. In contrast, Franko’s sister Lucija, one year
his junior, is described as “looking older.” Her completely gray hair suggests
the kind, proverbial grandma, while Franko’s hair, which appears almost silver,
lends him a “striking appearance” (Todorovski 12). The same gender pattern is
applied to Slavica’s appearance. She is described as a petite, shy old lady, rosy-
cheeked and with a pageboy haircut (Todorovski 21). Her stature resembles that
of a 14-year-old girl, leading Franko to (patronizingly) call her “Bambina,” which
she adores (Todorovski 21, 41). He is, in contrast, extroverted and charming. He
compliments women and kisses their hands, makes lavish declarations, and
does not allow them to pay for drinks – a repertoire of behavior representing
a form of “soft patriarchy” (but not in the sense as interpreted by William
Bradford Wilcox6). In the case of Franko’s relationship to Slavica, we see a form
of gendered behavior in which the man takes a paternalistic and protective role
characterized by elements of a traditional heterosexual relationship: flattery,
making compliments, using his masculine charm, courting, treating women
to drinks, and so on.
    In contrast to the free, unpredictable, “real,” and authentic life of Captain
Franko, Slavica’s life has been predictable, linear, and static. Their life narra-
tives are imbued with so-called “spatial metaphors” (Bruner 703), which in this

6 | According to Wilcox, the term “soft patriarchy” describes “‘new men’ who take a
more egalitarian approach to the division of household labor than their conservative
peers and a more involved approach to parenting than men with no religious affiliation.”
256   Marija Geiger Zeman, Zdenko Zeman, and Mirela Holy


      case have a gendered component. Slavica has spent her life in the domain of a
      predictable and safe home, “restricted by duties and bored” (Bruner 703) and in
      constant self-denial. The sphere of “home” included not only the private sphere
      of the household and family but also her monotonous job at a local library. The
      first tragedy to change her life was the sudden death of her husband, Andro,
      at his workplace, while the second was the complete devastation of the family
      home – the house she and her husband had built together with enormous
      sacrifice – during the war in Croatia (1991–95) (Todorovski 38). Among the
      things destroyed at that time were all photographs taken in her youth – the
      symbolic testament to the fact that she had once been young: “Without them, it
      seems as though I was never young” (Todorovski 76). Slavica learned from life
      experience and circumstances that “many things in life turn out against our
      wishes” (Todorovski 38). Thus her wish to visit the coast had remained forever
      unrealized as she and her husband invested their money in building a house,
      educating their children, and paying for their children’s holidays. Now, she has
      no one to travel to the seaside with and no longer even feels like going. One of
      the reasons for this – unmistakably suggesting another internalized gender
      stereotype – is the belief that women cannot (or should not) visit the seaside
      alone (Todorovski 39). Observing and evaluating her life trajectory, Slavica
      cannot avoid the conclusion that (her) life is unfair and stupid (Todorovski 77),
      and comparing her experiences to those of Captain Franko, she concludes that
      all his “amazing stories” have been incomparably lovelier than her ordinary
      life: “It’s like [comparing] The Arabian Nights and work in a warehouse” (Todor-
      ovski 76). The anecdotes from the life of Captain Franko represent what Bruner
      calls “the real world”: an external, “demanding,” “dangerous,” “unpredictable”
      world, a “special place” of “excitement and opportunity” (703).
           Slavica and Franko’s relationship takes a radical turn quite by accident. One
      day, Franko’s sister Lucija arrives unexpectedly for a visit just as Slavica is going
      to her room to fetch the figs she and Franko and had planned to enjoy with
      some dessert wine (prošek) (Todorovski 88). Slavica returns after some time,
      and Franko appears relieved that the two women did not meet. However, a
      big surprise follows: Slavica tells him of her chat with the Home’s employee
      Snježana, which Franko at first interprets “as typical female gossip” (Todorovski
      91). Here it is unnecessary to emphasize the gender stereotype produced by a
      patriarchal pattern that interprets every conversation between women (only)
      as an opportunity to exchange gossip. However, Slavica rejects his misconcep-
      tion, telling him that Snježana has told her that the Home is expecting a new
      resident: a retired sea captain, Jure Barić, from the coastal town of Šibenik.
      Slavica is especially excited about this news as she is looking forward to the
      three of them sharing stories about the sea voyages and the captain’s adven-
      tures (Todorovski 92). This is the moment when Franko must admit that he
      is not a real sea captain after all; in fact, he has spent his working life as a
                                     A New Home, A New Beginning, A New Identity        257


bank clerk and later as a post-office employee (Todorovski 93, 94). Slavica is
devastated by this confession for two reasons: first, she has been lied to by the
first man she had grown to love after the death of her husband (suggesting
a romantic aspiration in her relationship with Franko), and second, it turns
out that the stories she had so enthusiastically been listening to were actually
all in his mind (Todorovski 95). He also admits to her that his nephew Jerko,
who supposedly has been sending him figs and prošek wine, does not exist.
Rather, Franko himself had bought them at the market and a local wine shop
(Todorovski 96). After an argument and putting an end to their communica-
tion, Slavica finds herself in unbearable situation – just like Franko, who yields
to depression and despair (Todorovski 99). But she finally decides to step out
of the role of a shy and invisible old woman and to meet a real sea captain and
hear “true, real stories of the sea” (Todorovski 101).
     She approaches Captain Jure Barić while he is watching the news in the
TV room and begins to question him about his sea voyages, the ports he has
visited, and the adventures he has experienced. However, she is disappointed
by the drabness of Jure’s “maritime experience” (Todorovski 104). In his terse
responses there are no signs of colorful adventures: he captained the ferry
between Ancona and Split and was neither impressed nor inspired by the
sea, nor did he yearn for long sea voyages or for other, distant seas. Moreover,
Captain Barić does not even really look like a captain (for example, he does not
smoke a pipe) (Todorovski 104). After this disappointing conversation, Slavica
concludes that Captain Barić’s job had actually been as monotonous and boring
as her own in the library. An unexpected intervention follows on the part of
Professor Bučić and Doctor Lipovac, Franko’s two friends, who from the begin-
ning have doubted the authenticity of Captain Barić. Since Captain Barić is
the exact opposite of Captain Franko and diverges from accepted notions of a
real sea captain – he has no stories to tell about his sea voyages nor “words of
praise” for the sea; he does not sway when walking or have opinions on political
issues – they conclude that he has a “dubious past,” is a “murky creature” and
charlatan who they decide to debunk (Todorovski 106, 107). Here, a traditional
gender stereotype again becomes evident: the duo accuse Slavica of “treachery”
toward the man she loves, and they interpret Slavica’s “disloyalty” (Todorovski
106) again in a patriarchal frame: “a woman’s heart never owned the criterion
of objective assessment!” (Todorovski 108).
     These events ultimately lead to the restoration of friendship between Slavica
and Franko. She approaches him with the idea that she needs him and must
return to him because “Barić’s sea is no good” (Todorovski 113), despite the fact
that Franko’s stories were just a figment of his imagination. However, the resto-
ration of friendship returns a balance to their lives, and in the end this odd couple
goes to the seaside together, which is significant in multiple ways: Slavica will
finally get to see the sea, and their friendly relationship will enter a new phase.

      L e t M e Tell Your S tory :
      N arr atives about the (R e) invented Past
      As human beings “we are made up of, engage in, and are surrounded by
      stories,” or more simply put, “our worlds are stories” – just like our lives
      (McLean et al. 262). As Kearney (3) writes, “food makes us live” but stories
      “make our lives worth living.” Stories of all kinds (fictional and non-fictional)
      and narrative forms (novel, autobiography, etc.) are instruments for creating
      meaning and bringing order to chaos (Kearney 3). Storytelling “is an integral
      and consequential part of daily life,” and narratives of all kinds are “significant
      sites of communication” because through making and telling stories, “people
      make sense of their experiences, claim identities, interact with each other, and
      participate in cultural conversations” (Langellier and Peterson 1). Therefore,
      narratives and storytelling have multiple functions (psychological, social, phil-
      osophical, ontological, for example); stories operate “as an expressive embodi-
      ment of our experience, as a mode of communication, and as a form for under-
      standing the world and ultimately ourselves” (Brockmeier and Carbaugh 1).
           Indeed, telling stories is a basic human activity: through a story, indi-
      viduals explain themselves both to themselves and to others, thus providing
      themselves with an individual and communal identity (Kearney 3). Therefore,
      it is no exaggeration to say that “without a story, there is no identity, no self,
      no other” (Lewis 505). The “case” of Captain Franko is interesting to look at
      more closely because it raises some important questions about the relationship
      between the (re)construction of identity and the (re)creation of self-narrative.
      It is unnecessary to especially underline here that identity is one of the key
      categories in modern theoretical considerations and empirical interventions
      in the social sciences and humanities. Identity is a “central point of human
      personality” (Glińska 22), as well as a “social category that is understood as the
      self-definition of human being” (Glińska 20). Many contemporary sociological
      theories clearly show that individualism – as one of the fundamental values of
      modernity – has enabled the individual to “become the creator of his own biog-
      raphy (identity)” (Glińska 22), while postmodernity, stressing the importance
      of constant change and the uncertainty that accompanies it, has shown “that
      nothing in the world is finished, closed, finally defined” (Glińska 24). However,
      this volatility generated by continuous change does not hinder the tendency
      of identity to at least temporarily rest on some choices. Moreover, according to
      Zygmunt Bauman, it is precisely flexibility, volatility, ambiguity, and ambiva-
      lence that allow individuals, like tourists, to autonomously and freely decide
      when and with which fragment (personal or external) of the world they will get
      in touch (qtd, in Glińska 26).
           Identity and narrative are tightly connected. In their presentation of the
      history of the development of narrative theory, Brockmeier and Carbaugh high-
                                     A New Home, A New Beginning, A New Identity      259


light the important contribution of the theoretical considerations of Mikhail
Bakhtin, especially of his study Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics (1999). Bakhtin
draws attention to the “multi-vocal and polysemic nature of narrative” and to
the “structural analogies between novelistic discourse, life stories, and auto-
biographical memory” (Brockmeier and Carbaugh 7). For example, a “special
sense of temporality, polyphony, and intertextuality” is characteristic of the
modern novel but also of “the narrative construction of a life” (Brockmeier
and Carbaugh 7). When we discuss the identity dimension of a narrative,
many questions certainly arise, but one of them is especially significant when
analyzing Franko’s character: What type of personality did Franko create in the
life narrative that he daily recounted to Slavica?
     After having considered Franko’s biography and his motivation for creating
a new identity rooted in an imaginary (professional) past, we conclude that it
would be too simple (and superficial) to declare him an ordinary liar (which
does not mean that we would justify any form of misrepresentation). Franko’s
situation is somewhat more complex. Namely, after spending his working life
as a bank clerk and post-office employee, retirement intensified the issue of
identity that was so important to him. Dissatisfied with life in Split, as well as
with the fact that he had lacked the courage to realize himself professionally by
becoming a sea captain, Franko decides to finally resolve the crucial life conflict
between his “‘surface’ and ‘under-the-surface’ selves” (Berger and Luckmann
184) that made him spend most of his life in an ambivalent way: “I’ll be what
I always wanted to, and couldn’t: a sea captain! But because of my age, I’ll be
a retired sea captain” (Todorovski 95). Retirement encourages him to create
an alternative subjective reality in which he is able to realize his full potential
and create a new identity based on playing the role of a ship captain. Franko’s
role is based on an idealized and romanticized – almost naïve – notion of a sea
captain’s appearance and behaviour, and what his (professional and personal)
life should look like.
     The invention of a new identity is a form of identity strategy that relieves
Franko of his feeling of dissatisfaction stemming from the inauthenticity of his
existence and also allows him to establish and maintain a friendly relationship
with Slavica (as will be discussed below). Bakhtin believes that every narra-
tive has the potential for a “different story,” which is why there is a dynamic
relationship between “actual stories about real life with possible stories about
potential life” (Brockmeier and Carbaugh 7). The identity of Captain Franko
is diametrically opposed to the identity of Franko the clerk. Captain Franko’s
life is not trivial: he participates in the freedom and authenticity of “the real
world” (Bruner 703) and experiences adventure, excitement, and suspense. His
reinvented past stresses individualism and variations of a hegemonic mascu-
linity: he is a courageous and well-paid sailor, a hero who navigates the world
“according to ancient charts” (Todorovski 27), a loner dedicated and committed
260   Marija Geiger Zeman, Zdenko Zeman, and Mirela Holy


      to the sea, for which reason he has no family. As such, he is a sort of liminal
      persona, a wanderer always somewhere in between, who in direct contact with
      the infinity of the sea and the starry sky reflects on the human condition and
      his own position in the world. On the other hand, the narrative of his experi-
      enced and lived life is rooted in the contrasting sphere of “home” (Bruner 703):
      the monotonous and predictable life that Franko, at the moment of his confes-
      sion, will call “stupid and boring” (Todorovski 94).
           The narrative of his actual and truly experienced life reveals the average
      life of a clerk finally left by a wife tired of his stories and constant dreaming
      about sea voyages and ships (Todorovski 95). The lives of clerk Franko, librarian
      Slavica, and even of captain Jure Barić closely resemble each other, but there
      is one important difference: Barić never wanted anything else beyond what he
      had. He was not attracted to freedom, suspense or adventure, nor did he miss
      distant seas and unknown ports. On the other hand, unlike Slavica, who came
      to terms with her unfulfilled life with difficulty, though she was successful in
      her stoicsim, Franko’s “subjectively chosen identity” became “a fantasy identity,
      objectified” in his mind “as his ‘real self’” (Berger and Luckmann 191). The
      identity intervention of rewriting personal history, made real through Franko’s
      appearance and his stories, represents a conscious switching of worlds (Berger
      and Luckmann 176) – the world in which Franko was a clerk giving way to the
      one in which he was a captain. However, in order to “confirm” this (in reality
      unrealized) imagination-based identity, public performance and its external
      recognition and validation were required. Franko had to (and could) only get the
      latter in a new environment where his true identity was not known. The Home
      offered such an environment, far from Split, where he consistently performed
      his new identity with the help of invented strategies of self-presentation (for
      example, smoking a pipe, wearing a captain’s uniform, serving dried figs and
      prošek, reading books about ships, keeping a sailor bag for his clothes) and
      through telling his life story. This literary figure demonstrates how “listening
      to and telling stories” is not only “a human communication practice” but also
      a “performance” (Langellier and Peterson 2). Berger and Luckman point out
      that “subjective identity is a precarious entity,” dependent on relationships with
      “significant others” (118). In Franko’s time in the Home, Slavica is the leading
      “significant other” (occupying “a privileged position”) (Berger and Luckman
      171) with whom he talks mainly about his sea voyages, while to a lesser extent
      Doctor Lipovac and Professor Bučić also play this role.
           The collapse of Franko’s identity as Captain and of his imaginary world –
      in which he, like a mythical hero, sailed distant seas, struggled with pirates
      in Burma, and got into a fight with drunken Portuguese sailors (Todorovski
      53, 54) – occurs when Slavica learns that all his stories were fabricated and,
      unsurpisingly, feels cheated. Franko bases his defense on three arguments:
                                     A New Home, A New Beginning, A New Identity      261


1. he wanted to be a sea captain as an expression of his authentic self;
2. he had told her things that she herself had wanted to hear based on her
   discontent and longing to indirectly participate in the fullness of the free and
   authentic sailor’s life (proving that the goals of storytelling are connected
   with the “preferences of listeners” (McLean et al. 268): “In creating stories
   to please listeners, people create a certain kind of self in that moment that
   may have a lasting impact on the self” (Monisha Pasupathi et al. qtd. in
   McLean et al. 268); and
3. he raises the question of the relativity of truth and lies in everyday life,
   which seems to refer to the famous Thomas theorem, according to which
   “if men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences” (W.I.
   Thomas and Dorothy Swaine Thomas, qtd. in Merton 380).

The story also reveals that it is not only Franko who has secrets. For example,
Slavica eventually admits that she has been living in the Home for ten years.
Although she permanently repeats that her destroyed house is under recon-
struction and she will be moving out of the Home in the following year, in
reality the house has “long been restored” and she has not returned to Vinkovci
out of fear of loneliness and due to the emotionally difficult truth that there is
no place for her in the lives of her children (Todorovski 119). Professor Bučić,
meanwhile, reveals to everyone that he has been posing as a philosophy teacher
while he actually has a PhD in physics (Todorovski 62). While his roommate,
Doctor Lipovac, thinks this a manifestation of “the highest arrogance” clad as
false modesty, Professor Bučić explains that he had hidden his title to distin-
guish himself from Doctor Lipovac, as he believed that the life of “two doctors
in the same room, would not be good for … the polemic relationship” on which
their friendship was based (Todorovski 129).
    When in the end all secrets are revealed, Slavica and Franko restore their
friendship and thus also Franko’s identity as a sea captain and the world of his
adventures, which it has been shown were of existential importance to both.
Slavica concludes: “If all your life you wanted to be a captain, then be one,
because you are. When will you be one, if not now? To me, only you are a real
captain and only your sea is the right sea” (Todorovski 116, 117). This decision
can be interpreted as a kind of emancipatory act, freeing the character of Slavica
from the socially imposed norms, discourses, and limitations affecting the
perception, decisions, and way of life of the individual. In making this decision,
Slavica becomes an autonomous subject because – by accepting her “internal
freedom” (Bakhtin 12) – she emancipates herself from the constraints of the
external environment. The process by which we create a narrative of our lives
(or some of its aspects), and thus shape our identity, answering for ourselves
and others the fundamental question, “Who am I?,” is neither simple nor easy.
On the contrary, it is always about a dynamic, unstable, changeable, (spatially
262   Marija Geiger Zeman, Zdenko Zeman, and Mirela Holy


      and temporally) contextualized, relational, and partial construct in which
      lived experience and imagination, self-actualization and potentiality, past and
      present are intertwined, thus enabling us – from a freedom within – to commu-
      nicate and present ourselves to ourselves but also to (in)significant others.

Reflections on the Differentiation of Space
in Living and Care Settings

Isabel Atzl and Anamaria Depner


                                   “To thee, I’ll return overburdened with care
                                   The heart’s dearest solace will smile on me there.”

Care needs a place where it can be provided. This place is generally designed
as a structurally limited space such as a room or building, located in a residen-
tial house or a care facility. Particularly when care becomes an essential part
of life and is set up for the long term – in the case of chronically sick or older
individuals in need of care – the spheres of living and caring tend to overlap.
Space has to be created so that both appropriate care can be provided and the
individuals receiving care can have the design and setup of their living space
according to their personal taste and needs. Care and living therefore take place
in a common space.
    Nursing textbooks published in the nineteenth century describe in detail
how patient rooms within the home should be designed and set up to be in
line with the medical guidelines of the time. For the sick and elderly who were
usually cared for at home during this time period, a very specific environ-
ment was to be created that was conducive to the well-being of the patient,
from medical and nursing points of view. The main concerns for the design
of patient rooms in modern care homes are structural and technical safety
regulations. Consequently, as we will see, in the context of design, today’s text-
books still emphasize safety in the living and care environment. At the same
time, these rooms are not only working spaces for caregivers in an institutional
context but also the living spaces of people with very different life stories who
are now living together in a new location.

          The issues discussed in this chapter are based on work from an interdisci-
      plinary research project 1 that focused on the role of objects in past and present
      nursing and care settings using an inductive approach. Although working
      on distinct time periods and with different methodological approaches, the
      authors soon discovered connections among aspects and themes that led to
      an intensive interdisciplinary dialogue, which we present the first results of
      in this chapter. It covers the range of conditions found in patient rooms in
      a family home in the German-speaking area in the nineteenth century and
      personal rooms in a care home today in Germany, including both home care
      and institutions, where people are cared for in the same rooms in which they
      live. How and to what extent have patient care and personal needs been recon-
      ciled in the past and today? And what (hi)stories do these hybrid rooms and
      their inhabitants tell?
          To highlight these (hi)stories, we will first use an excerpt of a field report to
      provide insights into Anamaria Depner’s current research. This special narra-
      tive form will portray an example of daily life in care facilities. At the same
      time, it will lead us to the theoretical and methodological framework, which
      will then be briefly presented. In the following section, we will use content
      from nursing care textbooks to contrast the design and setup of care rooms in
      both historical and contemporary settings. We will then outline the general
      themes and collate them as part of the results. Finally, we will recommend
      areas for further research and return to the central question of the influence
      the care situation has on the design and setup of the room and what it might
      look like to meet personal and nursing care requirements in the respective
      contexts.

Scene Ia: Mr. Beck tells his stor y

The room we are going into next is occupied by two men. The bedridden man with the
parchment skin (Mr. Adam 3) is in the rear section of the room. The windows are high up
on the wall and his bed extends into the middle of the room. The second resident (Mr.
Beck) is in the front part of the room directly to the right of the door. Three photos hang
on the wall above his bed. One shows him already at an older age together with a woman
of about the same age, and the other two include two children, a boy and a girl. … While
Mr. Adam is being attended to, Mr. Beck addresses me, asking who I am, and we begin
to talk. I learn that the two younger people in the photos are his children. He tells me
that they are all already dead, both his wife and children who they had later in life. His
daughter had been sick, but he doesn’t say why his son is no longer alive. Mr. Beck says
he is “the last one.” He was no longer able to manage on his own, but here at the home,
everyone is very friendly and he is thankful for what he has. He smiles warmly as he tells
his story, and I listen and smile back and ask how long he has been here. “Quite some
time. And we’ll see for how much longer it will be,” he answers and tells me that things
could get better again and he would be able to move back into an apartment. Definitely
not on his own, but maybe he would find a nice lady who he would get along with well.
They do take good care of him here in the home, but it’s just not the same. “I’m still doing
well,” he says as he looks over at the bed where his roommate is lying and adds that he
would really like to live in a family again.

A man quite advanced in years shares a room with another resident whose
health is much worse. Their living spaces aren’t clearly separated and merge
together; they constantly have the other person in view. In the above scene, Mr.
Beck expresses his hope that he will soon be able to leave the care facility and
return to his familiar environment, even if he is quite a bit older and would
first have to find a wife, an apartment, and a home. He describes it as though it
could very well happen in the foreseeable future and not like wishful thinking.
The professional care provided by personnel in a care home and that of a wife
or partner – without which, according to his own view, he wouldn’t be able to
cope – are, in his mind, two essentially different types of care. This distinc-
tion doesn’t seem to be so important for Mr. Beck, although he does need
support; instead, where, and connected to this from whom, he receives support
is important to him.

      Scene Ib: The researcher reports

      Mr. Adam initially appears unresponsive and incapable of communication; the way he
      is lying in his bed with his mouth open and the expression on his face make it look
      as though he was far away, but when he notices that the caregivers have entered, he
      manages a smile and turns to gaze at us. He looks pleased. The caregivers begin with the
      nursing care routine. They first check to see if his absorbent pads need to be changed.
      Mr. Adam was given a laxative since he hadn’t had a bowel movement for several days,
      but it hadn’t yet taken effect. Then they roll Mr. Adam onto the other side, the two nurses
      working well together as a team. They ask him to “help them” and praise his coopera-
      tiveness. One of the nurses, in particular, Ms. Clauß, speaks a lot with the older man
      who is obviously still quite mentally capable, which is reflected in his facial expres-
      sion. … since Mr. Adams’ skin has become thin and fragile, it requires extra attention.
      The special bandages meant to protect the skin and allow it to heal are no longer neces-
      sary since the situation has improved, but it would still be necessary to apply his cream
      regularly, at least once a day, Ms. Clauß tells me. … While Mr. Adam is being attended
      to, Mr. Beck addresses me, asking who I am, and we begin to talk. … After the two nurses
      are finished with their work with Mr. Adam and we have just said goodbye to the two
      men (Mr. Beck squeezes my hand warmly and says that I should come again), Ms. Clauß
      says suddenly, “It finally worked” … and they both return to Mr. Adam. I’m told that the
      laxative had taken effect and am asked to wait outside as that was nothing for people
      without training. I leave, whereas Mr. Beck remains in his room.

      While Mr. Beck relates things about his life to a stranger who had just come
      into the room with the caregivers, his roommate Mr. Adam receives care. Mr.
      Beck tells the story of his family while the caregivers apply cream to Mr. Adam’s
      skin. Mr. Beck talks about moving back into an apartment while Mr. Adam’s
      teeth are brushed. After the conversation with the researcher, Mr. Beck sits on
      his bed while the caregivers change Mr. Adam’s absorbent pads after his laxa-
      tives had worked. This all occurs at the same time, in the same room, and in the
      same space. The room serves as living space for both Mr. Adams and Mr. Beck;
      it is where both men are cared for, the workspace for the caregivers, and the
      space where Mr. Adam relieves himself, is washed, and provided with further
      care. The important point here is that the room is used simultaneously in all of
      these contexts. This is also reflected in the furnishings. Their personal room
      in the care home is shaped by the design and set-up required for the care of
      the residents (Mr. Adam’s bed is in the middle of the room so that proper care
      can be provided) as well as the presence of biographical elements (the photos
      of Mr. Beck’s wife and children that remind him of his previous life as part of
      a family).

C urrent S tate of R ese arch and M e thods
The simultaneous occurrence of two situations or states that stand in tension
and cannot be resolved by “either/or” but instead can be described with a
“both–and” approach can be understood by applying the concept of ambiv-
alence. Recently, several scholars, including sociologist Kurt Lüscher and
educationalist Miriam Haller, have discussed the concept of ambivalence in the
context of identity-formation processes in old age. Ambivalence is presented
as a potential key concept in gerontology (Lüscher and Haller). Lüscher and
Haller are concerned with the experience of intrapersonal developments in old
age as a function of more powerful and often differing images and discourses
of social aging (for example, active aging as opposed to the elderly in need of
care). Such ambivalences, however, can also be found in the spatial environ-
ment of the elderly in an institutionalized context, where a new narrative for
personal identity concepts must be found in and through incoherent object
groups.
    In the cases we considered, the ambivalence is, in a simplified sense,
brought about by the fact that professional care is performed in the same
location where the patients live. In the case of care facilities, the place itself has
been moved to the margins of society, where the usual rules do not apply. It is
precisely because of a care home’s distinctive character as a place of professional
support for those in need of care that the distinction between workplace and
private zone cannot be maintained. But also in historical home-care contexts,
professional requirements were imposed upon private dwellings. Fifty years
ago, Michel Foucault proposed the term heterotopia for these types of social
“ambivalent spaces” and at the same time called for these phenomena to be
comprehensively researched in their various manifestations (for example, in
prisons, care homes, gardens, brothels, and sanatoriums) because of their diag-
nostic potential for society. According to Lüscher and Haller, ambivalence is
“defined as referring to the experience of vacillating between polar contradic-
tion of feeling, thinking, wanting and social structures in the search for sense
and meaning of social relationship, facts and texts, which are important for
unfolding and altering facets of the self and agency” (5).
    Does the arrangement of things, which must equally offer space for care
and biographical elements, contribute to the fact that although Mr. Beck is
content, he would articulate his desire to leave the residential care environment
(“to live in a family again”)? How does the design of personal rooms in a care
home affect the elderly people who live there?
    The fact that personal things can be significant for identity in a multi-
faceted way has been shown in research over the past five decades in ever
new ways and from the perspective of numerous disciplines. Pierre Bour-
dieu’s model of subtle distinctions does not head this list, but it is certainly
270   Isabel At zl and Anamaria Depner


      one of the most influential approaches to objects found in living spaces. In
      her research on life stories in East Indonesia, ethnologist Janet Hoskins even
      encountered biographical objects that can stand in as substitutes for people.
      The cultural psychologists Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Eugène Roch-
      berg-Halton, psychologist Tilmann Habermas, and anthropologist Daniel
      Miller, among other prominent researchers, have substantiated the identi-
      ty-creating function of personal objects in the context of the home. However,
      the potential that objects have to define personal space has not yet been given
      adequate consideration.
           In recent years, the interrelationship and interdependency of (everyday)
      objects and spaces (Rolshoven; Pfaffenthaler et al.) have been addressed in
      German-speaking history and cultural studies, partly also under specific refer-
      ence to the object-mediated spatial constellation in daily life (Depner, “Wie der
      Spatial”; Atzl, “Pflegeräume”; Keckeis, “Raum”; Oswald, “Lieblingsdinge”4).
      Living is seen here as an action that manifests itself in the interaction with
      personal objects that are used to divide a structurally defined space. When one
      actively exercises autonomy to arrange these objects, living areas are created.
      The focus on the identity of the individuals living there and their private needs
      and preferences is key. To summarize this notion, the philosopher Beate
      Rössler uses the concept of “local privacy,” something that is also addressed by
      Keckeis, “Dritte”).
           From a historical nursing perspective, there has not yet been research on
      room design and setup in the care context, nor have relevant personal objects
      been examined from this academic perspective. At first glance, the latter is
      surprising since biographical work today is an important practical instrument
      used in modern models of care, in which high value is placed on the indi-
      viduality and self-determination of those receiving care. In the sources that
      still exist from the past few centuries, the individual fate of patients has not
      been a high priority; the history of medicine and, to a lesser extent, the history
      of nursing have focused more on understanding the profession itself and its
      components rather than on patients. Patient histories used in research in the
      past two decades have attempted to place the focus on the individuals receiving
      care, but here neither room design nor objects have played a central role
      (Stolberg, Homo; Dinges et al.). In today’s nursing science context, personal
      and biographical objects are not explicitly considered in overviews of nursing

      4 | The latter three sources are based on lectures that were part of the event titled
      “Raum Ort Ding: Kultur und sozialwissenschaftliche Perspektiven” [“Space, Location,
      Object: Culture and Socioscientific Perspectives”], workshop conducted by the working
      group Materielle Kultur [Material Culture] in the German Anthropological Association
      (GAA) and the Institute of Gerontology held at Heidelberg University on 20–21 Nov.
      2014.

theory (see, for example, Meleis) or, for instance, in Erwin Böhm’s psychobi-
ographical care model. Environmental gerontology, however, has long empha-
sized that objects in the living environment should be viewed not only in light
of their practical and safety-related aspects but also as personally significant
objects (Saup; Wahl et al.; Oswald, “Subjektiv”; Beil). More recent studies from
the field of ethnology also describe the features of the relationship between
space, objects, and individuals in the context of institutionalized care (Löffler;
Depner, Dinge). It is in this research that we clearly see the narrative poten-
tial of objects that are connected to biographically relevant stories and identi-
ty-forming events.
     The theoretical basis for this research has recently proven to be quite sound,
but not particularly elaborate. Instead of focusing on the social, communica-
tive, or interpersonal space, which are themes that have often been examined
in publications over the last few years, our research centers on living situations,
the space required, and the design and setup of that space. This is surprising
because the “spatial turn” – which has long been and continues to be influ-
ential – was a contributing factor to the establishment of the “material turn.”
When brought together with inspiring concepts from material culture studies,
the connection between space, structurally defined spaces in particular, and
objects not only is theoretically and historically promising but also offers
opportunities for practical implementation in care facilities.
     In the framework of the “Pflegedinge” interdisciplinary research project,
we, along with our colleagues, have been focusing on care-related objects,
which include all the objects that are purposely or unconsciously used in the
context of care (Artner et al.). As established at the “Raum Ort Ding” interdis-
ciplinary workshop in Heidelberg in 2014, they are also essential for setting
up care rooms (Atzl, “Pflegeräume”). Objects always require space, no matter
if it is for their use or storage. In the middle of the nineteenth century, when
the objects used for care began to be mass produced, the question of where
these things should be placed became pressing. Where should they be laid
out? Where should measuring instruments, care materials, and increasingly
specialized supplies be kept and stored? How close or far should they be located
with respect to the place of care? To what extent do they contribute to the design
and setup of the room where care is required? What specific impact do these
things have on a care room?

      Patient Rooms in a Family Home in the Nineteenth Centur y

      In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, most older people were looked
      after and cared for in a home environment.5 If they didn’t have family, the only
      possibility was to consign them to poorhouses or hospitals, although by the
      beginning of the twentieth century, hospitals no longer served as multifunc-
      tional facilities (Murken; Verein für Krankenhausgeschichte). Older people
      who also needed to be cared for were to be found in the entire family setting.
      If care was necessary, the guidelines for optimal care included in nursing text-
      books until the early twentieth century were to be followed. The design and
      setup of the room described in these written sources was the best possible
      situation recommended by doctors, but many people were certainly not able
      to implement it. However, a description of the theoretical ideal emerged to
      which caregivers could aspire. In addition, the first nursing textbook, which
      was written by Florence Nightingale, published in 1859, and well received in
      Germany, emphasized the importance of patient-room design and efforts to
      provide an adequate environment.
          At first glance, it is surprising how much space – about a quarter – was allo-
      cated to these depictions in medical textbooks that date back to the beginning
      of the nineteenth century (e.g., Dieffenbach; Gedike). In the early twentieth
      century, such information was greatly reduced and found only in textbooks
      that also emphasized home care (e.g., Leo). For example, the ideal patient room
      derived from one of the first textbooks, written by the physician Johann Frie-
      drich Dieffenbach in 1832, includes architectural aspects as well as the design
      and furnishings of the room. Beginning with the location (preferably in the
      quietest part of the house and facing east or south), the room should also be
      simple and practical to clean and disinfect, and, if possible, the windows and
      doors should not be opposite one another, in order to avoid drafts. The best
      option for heating was a tiled stove. If the elderly or sick patient agreed, the bed
      would be put in the middle of the room so that caregivers could have access
      from all sides (54–55). Ideally, the bed should have an iron frame. The choice
      of bed was of paramount importance for elderly and critically ill individuals for
      the following reason: “A patient’s bed is their world – they live in it and cannot
      escape it. It is the first and last thing in our human life; newborns are laid in
      a bed and those who are dying do not like to leave their bed” (55, our transla-
      tion). Horsehair mattresses, deerskins, pillows, bed covers, and foot supports
      were recommended in every case. Gas and oil lamps offered patient-friendly

      5 | This remains true for German-speaking countries, where about three-quarters of all
      individuals in need of care are still cared for at home.
                                                                 Home Care Home      273


lighting, not too dark so that proper care could be provided, but not so bright as
to disturb the person lying in the bed. An overbed table, side table, commode,
and a comfortable upright chair with arm rests should be included, as should
an ordinary table and chair. There should be an adjoining room where supplies
that are not always needed or shouldn’t be kept in the patient room can be stored,
such as bandages and bedpans (30–69). Making it possible for the patient to
read seems to have been important. For example, patients were offered reading
supports and lamps (see, e.g., Böhme; Lees).
    The recommendations found in textbooks did not discuss personal items
in detail; the room design was based exclusively on medical and nursing care
requirements; individual needs were not mentioned. The recommendations
were for a room in a house that had to be set up differently or entirely remod-
eled. In this process the room took on a different character, and at the same
time the patient or elderly person with limited mobility would no longer or
hardly ever leave this room. Although the smells and noises of the house, its
inhabitants, and the view through the window remained the same, the environ-
ment was changed from the original living situation. The need for care in all its
facets imposed on the living area and created the ambivalence and heterotopia
described in the research context here.

Personal Rooms in a Care Home Today

Nursing textbooks today include far fewer recommendations on how to design
and set up rooms in private homes for individuals in need of care. Instead,
these texts focus primarily on the professional context of a care facility, and
the design and setup of these rooms are addressed only marginally at best.
The comparative example here (Menker and Waterboer) from a historic source
emphasizes safety in the sense of how to best minimize tripping, falls, and
sources of injury; it is thus representative of both current nursing instruc-
tion and classic gerontological literature in which objects are reduced to their
potential role as aids or obstacles. To this end, the nursing textbook considered
includes the following recommendations for private households: Special atten-
tion should be paid to ensure that the apartment or house includes enough
handles throughout as well as a door viewer and an emergency call system.
Steps or thresholds will need to be bridged with ramps, and dangerous carpets
and cords should be removed (Menker and Waterboer 613). To reduce safety
risks in care homes as much as possible, “mirrors,” “loud noises,” and “too
many colors or patterns and color contrasts” should be avoided, a “maximum
freedom of movement” should be ensured, and rooms should be marked with
“familiar symbols and pictures” to facilitate orientation (613). Alongside the
requirement established in 1832 that the room should be simple and easy to
clean, today minimizing fall hazards and barriers is emphasized.
274   Isabel At zl and Anamaria Depner


           In various sections in modern textbooks under the rubric “Setting up the
      living environment,” we find more advice on how best to design and set up
      resident rooms. They should not be “lacking stimuli,” “bare,” or “depressing”;
      curtains, carpets, bed linens, and the like should have warm but subtle colors;
      pictures and photos can be useful in the design, as can “objects that have
      meaning for the person concerned” (Menker and Waterboer 378–79, 613, 704).
      Many passages emphasize the fact that it is important to have plenty of natural
      light as well as good artificial light. The position of the bed is repeatedly iden-
      tified as relevant for well-being, stimulation of bedridden individuals, and also
      peaceful and deep sleep. Access for the caregivers and a sense of security for
      the people who are sleeping are problematized as possible conflicting needs
      when it comes to the positioning of the bed (581–82). In the context of this type
      of room design, both “stimulating” and “calming” effects are often desired.
           Unlike the past, today we have a good understanding of how to put these
      principles into practice. What do these rooms look like, then, when it comes
      to their practical implementation? The middle of the room is usually left
      empty and the rooms are not carpeted. Individuals receiving care should have
      freedom of movement, and caregivers should have space to carry out their work
      with the help of aids such as a commode or lift. Bandages, absorbent pads,
      and other such materials are still (at least as much as possible) stored outside
      of resident rooms and brought into and out of the rooms on a nursing cart by
      the caregivers – another reason that good accessibility and a certain amount
      of free space in the room are necessary, if possible close to the bed. Beds that
      used to be fixed in one place have become mobile; they now have wheels and
      can be adjusted into many different positions, and they are no longer located in
      the middle of the room because greater consideration is given to the occupants’
      habits and their need for a feeling of security when they are sleeping, as well as
      to changes in work procedures as a result of the increased mobility of the bed. If
      required, the bed can now be moved much more easily so that it can be accessed
      from all sides. As with the information provided in the historical sources,
      most beds today also have a significant inventory. In addition to blankets and
      pillows, a variety of materials are present to be used for positioning purposes
      and to keep the bed dry. Objects a resident uses often are placed together next
      to the bed, usually on a side table or nightstand. With Lawton (qtd. in Oswald,
      “Lieblingsdinge”), we can speak of an accumulation of important objects as
      “control centers.” It is precisely here that we find collections of objects that are
      frequently used, relevant to care, or of biographical or personal significance.
      A few additional biographical or personal items are placed on the walls of the
      residents’ rooms or, less often, on their bookshelves.
           In summary, we can single out the following two aspects: first, the interior
      design found in the modern care facilities we visited as part of our empirical
      research follows the few recommendations found in current nursing books to
                                                                 Home Care Home      275


the greatest extent possible; and second, the current core issues related to room
design and setup – for example, that proper care can be administered in the
living area – correspond with the historical topics, even if, as we will see next,
the content, implementation strategies, and common interest groups show
significant differences. We would now like to discuss some of these points of
overlap in more detail.

On closer examination, a number of questions arise, for example, about
involved parties and interest groups, power and knowledge distribution, distri-
bution and implementation of areas of competence, and the right to privacy. At
this point, we do not want to bring up general social debates and discourses or
the general pursuit of political and economic interests that often are discussed
without observing the particular situations. As a result of our inductive ways of
looking at the significance of objects in nursing and care settings, we want to
focus on the aspects that become apparent in each spatial situation and show
them by comparing a remarkable similarity over times and settings. We want
to shape these ambivalences and heterotopias in the past and today by using
this very particular perspective. This approach is a fundamental part of home-
care (hi)stories.

Involved Parties and Interest Groups

Which parties exerted or continue to exert influence on the design and setup
of care rooms? In the early nineteenth century, physicians first addressed and,
most importantly, tried to influence room design and setup. Caregivers, the
second group, were to implement these requirements as best they could and
defend these against the third group, which includes other relatives, neighbors,
and friends. If it was realized, this also meant that physicians gave caregivers
authority within the hierarchical structure of the care situation.
    Today, the parties involved in the design and setup of the living area of
an older person in need of care are quite different. Physicians are no longer
directly involved, whereas family members who are involved have even more
influence. As we were conducting the surveys, we frequently heard that the
objects in the room were placed or arranged as the family members had
wanted. In Germany, there are also many structural, safety, and legal regu-
lations, for example, in the form of Pflegegesetze (federal nursing-home regu-
lations) and various Länder-Heimrechte (state laws). To expand on this topic
would fill an entire book, as German bureaucracy is very well known for its
attention to detail. It is important to keep in mind that with this development,
276   Isabel At zl and Anamaria Depner


      new abstract but powerful parties, such as a number of legal institutions, care
      organizations, health insurance companies, and their evaluating authorities
      (for example, home supervisory authorities) become involved in the design and
      setup of living spaces.

      Power and Knowledge Distribution

      The historical literature primarily emphasizes the duty of care that caregivers
      are entrusted with. That duty is closely connected with the distribution of
      organized knowledge within the constellation of individuals involved in the
      care situation. The patient was considered to be in need of protection and was
      dependent on the help of the caregivers. In the best-case scenario, the caregiver
      took the patient into their care, while the physicians were responsible for the
      diagnosis and for conveying the necessary information to the caregivers, who
      then took this into account. In the textbooks, we read again and again about
      the danger of causing “a fatal cold” or “a fatal scare” (Dieffenbach 33) by not
      observing proper procedures or using care-related objects correctly. If a patient
      came close to dying because the caregiver failed to observe the procedures, this
      would undoubtedly result in the caregiver being morally accused, if not disci-
      plined by losing his or her employment. In the nineteenth and early twentieth
      centuries, trained caregivers found knowledge in textbooks to enable them to
      properly observe procedures in order to eliminate fatal threats. However, in this
      early phase of the development of the caregiver profession, knowledge produc-
      tion was exclusively the domain of the physicians who produced the medical
      texts. The individual experience of the caregivers themselves was deemed
      unimportant.
          It is the same today. Physicians have the competence to order the necessary
      treatment, and the caregivers are still the ones who know how to implement
      this treatment. In addition, there are now numerous guidelines and standards
      that these two groups must follow. In practice, however, the regulating institu-
      tions mentioned above are, along with the physicians, not regularly present at
      the caregivers’ place of work. When addressing the issues of power and knowl-
      edge, this must be kept in mind. The material logic of used objects in specific
      situations and the special characteristics of resident rooms often require that
      particular adjustments be made. In conversations and interviews with care-
      givers, we heard that this often resulted in uncertainty. Occasionally, instruc-
      tions are unclear, and sometimes they are difficult to understand or are contra-
      dictory. Concern is heightened when the structural conditions of the rooms
      cannot be brought completely in line with legal requirements, for example, as
      in the case of safety regulations. The possible consequences for an individual’s
      own professional future or the evaluation of the facility are threatening and
      engender fear. In addition, the regulations for the use of aids and care-related
                                                                 Home Care Home      277


objects and the preparation, handling, and other interaction with these create
uncertainty at times, and these regulations are followed with the utmost care.
Ensuring proper use of these objects is a decisive factor in the design and setup
of personal rooms in a care home.

The Historical Implementation of Areas of Responsibility

Prior to the early nineteenth century, bedside medical care often involved a
large group of people who gathered around the bed of the care recipient and
discussed and negotiated medical diagnoses and therapeutic procedures.
Neighbors, family members, healers, and sometimes several physicians all
participated in this communication process (Atzl et al.; Stolberg, “Kommunika-
tive”). Since caregiving was not yet a separate profession, physicians considered
it especially important to train everyone who had a key role at the patient’s
bedside in order to decrease the number of people involved in administering
care. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the situation changed and
the medical and nursing care of the patient or elderly person was placed in the
hands of specific individuals. Rest and a limited number of visitors became
important, and the caregivers were charged with regulating these. But physi-
cians maintained control, if not complete responsibility.

The New Right to Privacy

Privacy, intimacy, and shame began to be mentioned more often at the start
of the twentieth century and are now common themes in textbooks today. It is
thought proper to carry out the various basic activities of our daily life such as
food intake, elimination, personal hygiene, and sleeping in different, structur-
ally separated rooms intended for these purposes. Some of these daily activi-
ties can be performed in company, whereas for other activities that would be
unacceptable. Caregivers are encouraged to adhere to these social conventions
in care situations as much as possible. But with regard to private space, the
line is blurred between the living space of the care recipient and the work-
space of the caregivers in order to accommodate the organization of work – and
to the detriment of personal privacy.6 In the extract from the research report
included above, we see how a bedridden person receives food, has personal
hygiene carried out, and even eliminates in the same room where he spends
his days. And in the same room, feces are removed and patients are cleaned
and sometimes dressed in new clothes. This overlapping of space – compared

6 | Research into the “commode” object by our colleague Lucia Artner is a prime
example of how the positioning of care aids can change the understanding of space
between a living and a working space (Artner and Böhringer).
278   Isabel At zl and Anamaria Depner


      to what is common practice in our society – culminates in the double use of a
      room that is home to two individuals. The room belongs to Mr. Adam just as
      much as it does to Mr. Beck. And that is also the case in the moment in which
      Mr. Adam is attended to by the nurses after he has had a bowel movement. Mr.
      Beck doesn’t leave the room then; instead, he “stays in his room.” There seems
      to be no struggle or contradiction between his privacy and Mr. Adam’s.
          But what qualifies a room as a private space? As Rössler argues, “Privacy
      isn’t only created in rooms when I have authority over who is allowed to enter
      but also when I can organize the space for myself so that the objects in the
      rooms have a certain order and that specific objects are present that make
      the room have meaning for me, personal meaning” (Rössler 255–56). A large
      degree of “local privacy” that can be connected to a room the residents set up
      themselves is therefore crucial for a comfortable atmosphere. It is important
      that very specific, meaningful personal items that were selected independently,
      for whatever reasons, are present. The experience of the self and defining one’s
      own individuality are elements of privacy and a comfortable ambience. Living
      spaces need room for private and personal (hi)stories as well as the identity of
      their residents.
          But in the course of history, personal and biographical objects in resident
      rooms have been rare, and very seldom have they been chosen and placed by
      the residents of the rooms themselves. Place is found, in particular, for those
      objects that are needed or required to carry out nursing-care procedures, but
      even private things are often used for the purpose of care. In the inventory of
      personal rooms in a care home, what materializes is the history of the tech-
      nical and professional progress of nursing care, not the history of the resi-
      dents. Indeed, the latter seems to be interchangeable. It should be as simple as
      possible to make space in these rooms for the next person in need of care who
      moves in with their own life story – and as few objects as possible should have
      to be taken out.
          Currently, “quality of life” and “well-being” (e.g., Kruse) are increasingly
      becoming the focus of research and are seen as an approach to working with
      care-home residents, especially with regard to people with dementia. Care
      homes, in line with current endeavors, should become more of a home in the
      sense of a self-directed “home sweet home” and not in the sense of an other-di-
      rected “care home.” This can succeed only if the objects of self-narration that
      strengthen identity are provided with more space. It is essential that the resi-
      dents are more involved in the selection and arrangement of these objects and
      that the normative-nursing or regulating-legal view puts aside its paternalistic
      entitlement.

C onclusion
Comparing our research results reveals aspects that have considerable influ-
ence in the design and setup of care rooms in both the historical and modern
contexts. The parallel is that care rooms in the past were and today still are
geared toward providing the most ideal care situation and work structure and
ensuring an efficient workflow. The main focus is the care “choreography,”
which is clearly central and focused on the care needs of sick or frail older
individuals. These needs alone seem to be emphasized, because both in the
ideal situation of private rooms in a family home in the nineteenth century and
in personal rooms in a care home today, the focus has been on proper nursing
care. For this care, the meaning of which can be measured by economic means,
the fate of the individual seems to take second place. Two hundred years ago,
the focus was on improving the overall care situation for patients and devel-
oping guidelines to ensure adequate care. Today, the concerns include the cost
of placing older people in living situations outside of the family, demographic
developments, and the high demand for places in care homes, all of which have
greatly influenced the design and setup of living spaces that must also serve as
care rooms for every type of care situation. For the design and setup of these
personal rooms in a care home, regulations and requirements from external
institutions come before the individual’s daily living needs and habits.
    In work situations with a medical focus, personal items have not historically
been emphasized in the literature, even if care is being provided in private
rooms. Today, personal things are ascribed the role of potential stimulators,
but they are then pushed to the edge of rooms; sometimes, the only space to be
found is on the walls. The fact that resident rooms are primarily workspaces
for caregivers in an institutionalized context, but that at the same time they are
also still private living spaces for people, can be seen in only limited form in
the teaching texts presented – and therefore also in the discourse-forming and
practice-formative media. Considering and researching the hybrid function of
these rooms more closely from the perspective of the employees and especially
the residents is an area that we see as promising future research.

Conflicting Images of Long-Term Residential Care

Few institutions have been surrounded by as much confusion, such gendered
contradictions, and so many cultural anxieties as care homes for older adults,
which bear the weight of cultural and economic uncertainties around popu-
lation aging, changing perceptions of frailty and family ties, the meaning of
dependence and independence, and fears of mortality. As one former care aide
observes, “finding no one to blame for old age, why not blame those who house
it?” (Tisdale xii). In their recent study Residential Care Transformed: Revisiting
the Last Refuge, British gerontologists Julia Johnson, Sheena Rolph, and Randall
Smith agree that “what people fear most is not residential care per se but ageing
and the challenges of deep old age” (216).

           In this chapter I will explore a series of recurring narratives about care
      homes that featured prominently in policy discourse and in the media in
      Ontario, Canada’s largest province, primarily during the post–World War II
      era. During these years, the modern old-age home emerged out of the shadows
      of its poorhouse origins as both a companion institution to the postwar hospital
      and an alternative to the family home as an appropriate site for the care of
      vulnerable older adults living out the final years of their lives. Neither purely
      medical settings nor “homes,” long-term residential-care facilities continue to
      exist in the “somewhere between,” which complicates their efforts to attract
      both broad public support and the sufficient funding required to provide a
      good quality of life for their residents and a rewarding working environment
      for their staff. How these competing stories first emerged within Ontario and
      how they continue to intersect will form the core of my discussion below. I will
      conclude by looking at the ambiguities and contradictions contained in some
      of the Ontario government’s most recent policy documents on the future of
      long-term care.



      “S elfish C hildren ”
      Old age and the institutional care of aging adults emerged as a policy problem
      in Ontario, as in the United States, in the last quarter of the nineteenth century
      (Montigny; Haber; Haber and Gratton). Several trends converged, by the 1890s,
      to create the perception of an old-age crisis. The first was population aging.
      Due to declining fertility rates and increased life expectancy, the percentage of
      Ontarians over the age of 60 rose from 4.6 in 1871 to 8.4 by 1901. The growing
      visibility of an aging population was also made more evident by the increasing
      proportion of all adults over 20 in Ontario who were also over 60. As Edgar-
      André Montigny observes, “one was more than twice as likely to encounter
      elderly people among the population as forty years earlier” (35–36).
          As the numbers of adults over 60 grew, economic conditions for their work-
      ing-age children also deteriorated, due to a sharp recession in the early 1890s.
      The result was an upsurge in demand, both from the aged without kin and
      from those whose families could no longer support them, to gain admission
      into Ontario’s county poorhouses, which grew from only 9 in 1889 to 34 by
      1912, in addition to 40 charitable city refuges also subsidized by the province
      (Williams 55). Increasingly, other categories of the dependent poor such as
      widows, the disabled, and children were also being rehoused in special insti-
      tutions or programs of foster care. By default, the aged became the “leftovers”
      of the poorhouse, comprising 80 per cent of inmates in Ontario’s Houses of
      Refuge and 70 per cent of inmates in its Houses of Industry. These were the
      elderly now most visible to the state. And due to the rigid admission policies
                                                      Home, Hotel, Hospital, Hospice       285


mandated for these facilities, they were seen as a population that was over-
whelmingly decrepit, unproductive, and helpless (Montigny 98–99).
    Why did so many of the poor now seem to be old?2 And why were they
demanding entry into refuges? The responsibility, according to provincial
officials, lay with families, not the state. Old people, they argued, were being
“foisted upon the government” in order to shift the burden of their care “from
the home to the state.” Building more institutional care would simply “take
away … the filial obligations for the support of aged parents which is the main
bond of family solidarity” (Montigny 32, 103). After 1912, the construction of
new houses of industry or refuge virtually ground to a halt, despite a 218-per-
cent increase in the proportion of the population over 60. By the mid-1940s,
10,000 needy aged were crammed into structures originally designed to house
fewer than 5,000 (Williams 56–57). Creating a narrative of selfish families,
however, allowed the government to justify policies designed to avoid spending
more money on the problem.



“R efugees ”
From the 1890s until the 1940s, the fate of aging inmates in Ontario’s Houses
of Refuge was bleak. Admitting to any “friends or family” able to provide care
denied them the right to be admitted (Montigny 102). Since Houses of Refuge
were located on working farmland outside towns and cities, they also physically
segregated the aged from the majority of the population. Inmates lost their
right to vote as well as their right to leave the institution without the permission
of its superintendent. Living in dormitories of 10 to 18 beds, they also lost their
right to privacy (Snell 39, 47; Struthers, Limits 56–57).
     If physically able to work, they were required to do so, without pay, in order
to help defray the costs of running the refuge. If they could no longer work,
which became increasingly the case as the average age and frailty of residents
rose over time, they were segregated within the oldest and most unattractive
areas of the buildings, often basements or attics, which were renamed the
“Old Persons’ Home” or “Old Persons’ Section” (DesRoches 64–65). If they
misbehaved, or became “gravely disturbed mentally,” they could be confined to
a locked and barred cell in the basement (Struthers, Limits 57). Married couples
were not allowed to live together, nor were residents allowed to marry (58). The
labels “decrepit” and “helpless” were used to describe older inmates in order to
“justify [their] segregation” and to appeal to public sympathy and support. Due

2 | In fact this was an illusion. As Montigny notes, “contrary to common assumptions the
vast majority of elderly people in late-nineteenth century Ontario lived independently
and were capable of maintaining themselves” (52).

      to their perceived maternal instincts, women took over the administration of
      these parts of the refuges whose residents were increasingly seen as “childlike”
      (DesRoches 64–65; Snell 46).
          By the early twentieth century, many Houses of Refuge were given new
      names such as “Home for the Aged, Friendless, and Infirm” (Snell 47), but this
      rebranding, Cheryl DesRoches argues, “awarded neither additional status nor
      additional comfort.” It only acknowledged that these were places where “the
      old people are not expected to work if sick, or unable to work” (DesRoches 70).
      Before World War II, these homes never lost the stigma of their poorhouse
      origins. As one 75-year-old retired Ontario schoolteacher put it in 1925, when
      pleading to the federal government for an old-age pension scheme,

      I do not want to beg … Often the only resource for men who have lived useful lives …
      is to go to one of … those horrible, abominable institutions, the county poor houses …
      those PLAGUESPOTS of the universe.… They may do for some of the feeble-minded and
      for sots, but certainly are not places for decent citizens. (qtd. in Struthers, Limits 50)



      “A N ice H omelike A tmosphere ”
      By 1945, demographic changes within Ontario and new conceptions of
      social citizenship emerging out of the Depression and war years intensified
      the demand for different approaches to the care of vulnerable older adults as
      the percentage of the population aged 65 or older ballooned from 5.5 to over
      9.0 between 1901 and 1951. The answer to their needs could no longer be the
      poorhouse. Inspectors’ reports in 1946 revealed more than 500 frail elderly
      crammed into “temporary” beds in the attics, basements, and hallways of the
      province’s houses of refuges, all of which had long waiting lists for admission.
      “Upon entering these [homes],” one complained, “the first impression was an
      overpowering odour … of human excrement, body odours, boiled cabbages and
      strong disinfectant. With the wooden floors, cloth upholstery on the furniture,
      poor plumbing and lack of ventilation it was almost impossible to keep down
      odours” (Struthers, “‘Nice’” 337). In Toronto, municipal officials noted that
      while the city’s population had quintupled since 1900, institutional shelter for
      the elderly had only doubled. Out of this crisis had emerged the “rise of unsu-
      pervised, commercialized accommodation” for those with “minor and serious
      illnesses common to aged people.” Public-health officers reported growing
      numbers of the elderly “lying sometimes in filth and squalor in a rooming
      house with no one to feed or attend them, sometimes in rooms so cold that
      they cannot be bathed by a visiting nurse and no hospital will accept them”
      (Struthers, “Reluctant” 172–73).

     Other changes also heightened the search for institutional alternatives to
either poorhouses or family care of the aged. By the 1940s, over 40 per cent of
the Ontarians aged 70 and over would be collecting means-tested provincial
old-age pensions, first made available in 1929. In 1951, their numbers more
than doubled when a universal old-age pension of $ 40 a month became avail-
able for all Canadians aged 70 and over, a change that greatly expanded the
market for sheltering older adults. A housing crisis in larger cities such as
Toronto also reduced the ability of families to take in bedridden aging parents
(Struthers, “Reluctant” 172–73). As a result, by the 1940s, government officials
were no longer blaming “selfish and ungrateful children” for abandoning their
familial responsibilities. “With the best of intentions,” they conceded, “younger
members of families are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain the older
members who have not been able … to look after themselves” (Ontario, Caring
for the Aged; Davies, Into the House 102). The increasing employment of married
women throughout the 1950s also complicated the situation. As newspapers
pointed out, coping with the chronic illnesses of the aged “requires almost
constant attention and care which the busy housewife of today feels she cannot
provide while looking after her own children or working at the same time”
(Struthers, “Reluctant” 173).
     Over the next three decades, two new policy narratives around the shelter
and care needs of Ontario’s vulnerable older citizens took shape. The first
focused on the growing backlog of hospital “bed-blockers” and the greed of
private nursing homes. This was a policy discourse shaped by a search for regu-
lation, safety, cost savings, and efficiency. The second centred on the creation
of a new welfare state, a visible symbol of which was abolition of the poor-
house and its replacement by a rapidly expanding provincial network of public
and charitably owned and operated Homes for the Aged. This was a narrative
shaped by images of comfort, dignity, happiness, and “home.”
     “Home dreams” of privacy and comfort for nuclear families were extremely
compelling for the generation of Canadians emerging out of the years of Depres-
sion and war, and they fuelled the rapid expansion of the suburban experience
(Strong-Boag). One of the by-products of these “dreams” for postwar politicians
and social planners was the desire to eradicate the old Victorian poorhouse
and replace it with a “reformed old age home … fit for the newly minted ‘senior
citizen.’ It would be a modern, single story complex, decorated inside with light
paint rather than dark stained wood. Communal areas would bring together
residents for social events rather than merely for meals. All of this suggests a
middle-class family home” (Davies, “Renovating” 162).
     As Canada’s wealthiest and most urbanized province, Ontario was at the
forefront of this campaign. In the two decades following the passage of its
“Homes for the Aged” Act in 1949, the province and its municipalities spent
$ 110 million constructing 89 modern homes for the aged, to care for more than
288   James Struthers


      15,000 residents. Churches, ethnic communities, and other charitable organi-
      zations accommodated another 12,000 within 92 non-profit institutions. Over
      the 1960s alone, the annual cost of institutional care for the aged would jump
      from $ 70 million to $ 455 million, and with 8.9 per cent of its 65-and-over
      population living within institutional care by the mid-1970s, Ontario’s rate of
      institutionalized elderly was 75 per cent higher than that of Great Britain and
      41 per cent greater than that of the United States (Struthers, “‘Nice’” 335; Forbes
      et al. 43–44).
          The key significance of the province’s Homes for the Aged initiative lay in
      its recognition that medical and social barriers to independent living rather
      than destitution should form the principal criterion governing admission. The
      intended clients were older Ontarians from all walks of life, not simply the
      poor. Once admitted, all “residents,” as they were now called, would be treated
      equally as “paying guests”, whether their care was subsidized by a local welfare
      department or came out of their own, or their children’s income. The prov-
      ince’s Conservative welfare ministers explicitly underscored the symbolism of
      this change at ribbon-cutting events held to celebrate the opening of the new
      facilities across the province during the 1950s and 1960s. “This … is not a poor-
      house where unwanted people of the community are placed,” W.A. Goodfellow
      pointed out at one such event in 1954. Instead, he and his successor Louis Cecile
      likened Ontario’s new “ultramodern” homes for the aged either as dwellings
      that “match the finest of hotels” or as places where aged citizens could “enjoy
      all the physical comforts of a family home.” In the new world of the postwar
      welfare state, families should no longer feel shame in seeing their aging parents
      in care homes. “The attitudes today are entirely different,” Cecile proclaimed
      in 1962. “When an aged person cannot live in a private household, the family
      recognizes the Home for the Aged as a public service available to everyone …
      The elderly person accepts the Homes as the best place in the community for
      his care and comfort.” Or as the president of Ontario’s Association of Homes
      for the Aged boasted in 1967, “twelve years ago it was unusual for families to
      place a relative in a home … Today it seems to be a status symbol” (Struthers,
      “‘Nice’” 337–38). Built mostly as 100- to 300-bed single-storey facilities, with
      three or four wings radiating out from a central core, they were located most
      frequently on the suburban fringe, often on farmland formerly occupied by
      older Houses of Refuge. Sleeping two or four to a room, they were still clearly
      institutions, not homes or hotels. But their open style, attractive colour and
      lighting schemes, spacious reading and television areas, tuck shops and beauty
      parlours, restaurant-like dining rooms, and new emphasis on recreational and
      physical activity provided a fitting architectural symbol of the entitlement of
      Ontario’s pensioned citizens. Unlike the Houses of Refuge they replaced, the
      aim of these Homes for the Aged, according to government spokesmen, “was
      not to preserve a mere existence but to promote happiness” (Struthers, “‘Nice’”
                                                  Home, Hotel, Hospital, Hospice    289


338). Gone were the “Superintendents” and “Matrons” of the older poorhouse,
to be replaced by a new cadre of female professionals working as nurses, social
workers, nutritionists, and physiotherapists, as well as occupational therapists
whose goal was to “add life to years rather than years to life.” As Megan Davies
points out, “with their special nurturing qualities and their cultural connection
with ‘the home,’ women were seen as essential in a modern, compassionate
institution for the aged.” At the same time, the emphasis on their maternal
“nurturing” skills, combined with the absence of male employees, also under-
scored “the secondary status of these facilities and the ageist equation of the
elderly with children” (Davies, Into the House 93–94).
     For the first thirty years after the war, Ontario’s homes for the aged also
struggled over the question of how much medical as opposed to “social” care
they should or could provide. Throughout the 1940s, Ontario’s hospital infra-
structure, which had not grown since the 1920s, struggled to find beds for “even
urgent [acute care] cases … because there are so many elderly, helpless, sick,
occupying beds, living and boarding in these expensive institutions and for
whom no place is available when they are ready for discharge,” Toronto health
officials and physicians complained in 1947. “They just remain in hospital and
keep patients out for whom something could be done.” The solution was to
build “a low cost home for the aged.” In response, the Ontario government
mentioned the need for accommodating a small proportion of so-called “bed-
care” patients in its 1949 “Homes for the Aged” Act. “We feel this will be a
great saving to the taxpayer,” its welfare minister argued. “These chronical-
ly-ill, bed-ridden persons need only bed-care, not the active valuable bed-space
they have been taking in general hospitals” (Struthers, “‘Nice’” 338–39). But
the number of beds and the degree of medical care to be provided was never
clearly defined. Homes for the Aged were specifically intended as “social care”
rather than as “medical” facilities, which is why they were placed within the
jurisdiction of the Department of Public Welfare rather than the Department
of Health. Few issues would become more blurry over the next 30 years than
determining the precise medical boundaries separating Homes for the Aged,
on the one hand, from local hospitals and/or private nursing homes, on the
other.
     The principal criterion for admission to a home was proof that applicants
were “incapable of looking after themselves in the community and require
care.” However, the definitions of “incapable” and “care” could be elastic,
ranging from frailness, physical disability, mental confusion, incontinence,
or the inability to shop, cook, clean or climb stairs, to simply difficulties in
finding an affordable place to live. The starting assumption, however, was that
most clients would be able to walk through the front door. The 1952 brochure
advertising one new home, for example, described a “home for elderly citizens
designed to accommodate … those who are self-reliant and active.” Out of
290   James Struthers


      this home’s 110 beds, only 17 were set aside for “special care due to physical
      or other infirmities.” Similarly, when Toronto’s first 700-bed Home for
      the Aged, renovated from a former veterans’ hospital, opened in 1949 on a
      supposedly temporary basis, in order to help the city cope with an acute-care
      hospital-bed shortage, its director nonetheless protested that to devote more
      than one-third of its capacity to the care of the bedridden “would be in effect
      to change [its] character … from predominance of ambulatory residents to
      that of the infirm” (Struthers, “‘Nice’” 340). Seven years later, the city built a
      new 625-bed special-purpose home for the aged, on farmland 60 kilometres
      away from the downtown core, so that senile and bedridden residents from its
      other six municipal homes could be relocated in order to avoid compromising
      the “homelike atmosphere” of these other homes (CUPE). More than 200
      of its first residents came from the original downtown Home for the Aged
      (which remained operating until 1981). Segregation of the senile, either in
      small separate wings in newer homes or in a 625-bed “special care” home,
      government officials maintained, was necessary in order to “shield … from
      the sights and sounds of sickness and senility those who were in a better
      state to appreciate their surroundings and use the recreational areas, the craft
      and hobby rooms, gardens and chapel” (Williams 60). New semi-professional
      female staff in these homes also preferred to deal with “ideal” residents who
      were “willing and able to participate in therapeutic and recreational activities.”
      Those perceived as “not treatable” were thought better fitted for life “in a custo-
      dial institution” (Davies, “Renovating” 172–73).
          The new Homes for the Aged program did have its critics. Some argued that
      “the old folk have been placed in the beautiful glass and brick tombs outside
      our cities, their precious privacy invaded, and their right to make their own
      plans taken from them” (Gillen). Social workers specializing in the problems
      of old age also argued that “communal care rather than institutional care …
      located in the actual neighbourhoods where these folk have always lived” was a
      more humane approach. Citing European examples, Toronto’s Welfare Council
      in 1948 called for the construction of “co-operative homes to accommodate
      couples as well as single people, apartments for old people as part of public
      housing projects, [and] apartments specially designed for the convenience of
      older people,” to be located not on the outskirts of the city but “close to centres
      of activity which include shopping sections, churches, transportation, and
      theatres,” so that the elderly could feel they “belonged to the community and
      had responsibilities” (Struthers, “Nice” 342–43). These criticisms and alterna-
      tives, although prescient, would not be taken up by local and provincial govern-
      ments in Ontario until the late 1960s and early 1970s, when federal government
      funding for seniors’ housing became available on a sustained basis (Bacher;
      McMahon).
                                                  Home, Hotel, Hospital, Hospice    291


    Homecare was also suggested as a better alternative. As Toronto’s largest
newspaper argued in 1951, the province’s Homes for the Aged program “pro-
mote[d] huge and costly institutions which before long may become obsolete”
and which too often were “being put up in the country, far from familiar inter-
ests.” Why not look to British examples as an alternative and build “self-con-
tained apartments or co-operative houses” for the aged combined with “com-
munity social services – home nursing, domestic aide, and personal case work
and recreation to ensure comfortable and secure independence of aged persons
living in their own apartments, flats, or lodgings” (Struthers, “‘Nice’” 343)? At
Ontario’s first Conference on Aging, held in 1957, such concerns were voiced
repeatedly, but they fell by the wayside due to major changes in provincial and
federal shared-cost programs that same year. In 1957, Canada launched a uni-
versal hospital-insurance program that excluded federal funding for homecare
as an insured service. The next year, the federal government also allowed older
adults institutionalized in special care homes to be included, as “unemploy-
ables,” for a cost-shared subsidy claimed by provinces under the new Unem-
ployment Assistance Act, which provided relief to the jobless not eligible for
unemployment insurance. By 1962, 21 per cent of Ontario’s funding received
through this legislation went toward supporting the care of the elderly and
disabled in such homes. These decisions intensified the biases in favour of
institutional rather than community-based approaches to caring for vulnerable
older adults (Taylor 129–31; Struthers, Limits 190–91, 353). Homecare and assist-
ed-living alternatives, first put forward in the 1940s and 1950s, would return
as significant policy responses to the emerging fiscal crisis in hospital and
long-term residential care only from the mid-1980s onwards (Baranek et al.;
Struthers, “No Place”).
    Despite these criticisms and shortcomings, the construction and expan-
sion of Ontario’s Homes for the Aged during the 1950s and 1960s represented
a high-water mark of “positivist” public perceptions of the old-age home as
an innovative and progressive development within the postwar welfare state
(Davies, “Renovating” 156). As one civil servant long engaged with the program
wrote, in looking back on this era decades later, these “well-built, almost luxu-
rious group homes … each a local showplace in civic services … [were] expres-
sive of the most up-to-date and benign ideas concerning the quality of group
living” (Williams 65). To Ontario’s provincial treasurer, in 1964, the program
also symbolized “the tribute which the present pays to the past. It is a concrete
expression of the younger generations of citizens honouring their fathers and
mothers” (Struthers, “‘Nice’” 346; emphasis added).
292   James Struthers


      “R eluctant Partners :
      N ursing H omes and H ospitals in O ntario”
      A year after the passage of the Homes for the Aged Act, a report released by
      Ontario’s Health Survey Committee revealed that there was “a shortage of
      10,500 acute treatment hospital beds across the province,” a situation that
      government officials deemed was “nothing short of a tragedy” (Struthers, “No
      Place” 392). A major cause was the growing number of indigent “older men
      and women, disproportionately elderly, and unable to receive convalescent care
      at home,” who were suffering from chronic cardiovascular, respiratory, and
      digestive problems. Their long-term “bed-blocking” was keeping self-paying
      patients out of local hospitals, thus eroding their fiscal integrity (Gagan and
      Gagan 83–86).
          During the previous decade, Toronto, where the problem was most severe,
      had begun improvising its own solution. Starting in 1941, the city started to
      subsidize the discharge of elderly patients, at the rate of $ 40 a month, about
      half the cost of their hospital care, from hospital indigent wards to selected
      private nursing homes. By 1947, this “temporary” program, which started
      with only 30 patients, was now paying for the care of over 600 aged in private
      homes (Struthers, “Reluctant” 174). But what kind of care were they getting? No
      one really knew. “[S]ome of them provide satisfactory care and some doubtful
      care, but under present circumstances adequate or effective supervision is
      impossible,” city officials confessed in 1946. A major scandal that same year,
      uncovered by Ontario’s Old Age Pension Commission (OAP), forced the city
      into action. In one Toronto home, the OAP reported, 36 pensioners had died
      over a two-year period, a mortality rate double that of the city’s Hospital for
      Incurables. When a suspicious pension official visited the home to find out
      what was going on, he discovered a disturbing scene: “Practically everyone in
      the house had severe colds, all the old people were coughing and one … was
      very ill in bed with pneumonia. A slim, frightened looking person had two
      black eyes and a badly swollen face.” Another elderly lady had a “bad bruise on
      the left temple” and “blood … oozing [from her] stocking from the knee to the
      ankle.” Further investigation revealed a home swarming with cockroaches and
      packed with 35 sick, elderly patients, locked in, seven to a room, where door-
      knobs had been removed so doors could not be opened from the inside. Six men
      were sleeping in the basement, five more in the attic. In response, Toronto’s
      city council passed Ontario’s first by-law requiring the registration, licensing,
      and inspection of private nursing homes. Lacking enforcement, it was largely
      a symbolic gesture. Unlicensed homes continued to operate and even to receive
      per diem stipends from the city welfare department for the care of indigent,
      elderly patients. Since hospitals and municipal homes for the aged already had
                                                    Home, Hotel, Hospital, Hospice     293


long waiting lists, Toronto officials confessed, there was little else they could do
(Struthers, “Reluctant” 175–76).
    Ten years later, not much had changed. Only a dozen cities had enacted
nursing-home by-laws, which, health officials agreed, were “not in accor-
dance with any real standards.” Few homes provided much more than room
and board, “with practically no nursing care of a skilled type.” Local Medical
Officers of Health seemed “generally [to] show little or no interest in a Nursing
Home,” provincial officials conceded by the end of the 1950s. Their hands were
tied. “We know very little about the exact number or kind of nursing homes
which exist,” nor was there any commonly accepted definition of what they
were. Most were unlicensed, but they could hardly be closed. “What would we
do with the patients if it were decided to close them?” a public health officer
asked (Struthers, “Reluctant” 177).
    Ontario’s 1957 Conference on Aging provided a forum for action. Over 150
private nursing home proprietors attended and two years later organized them-
selves into the Associated Nursing Homes Incorporated of Ontario (ANHIO),
the first provincial lobby group for their sector. Over the next six years the
ANHIO would take the lead in successfully pressuring a reluctant provincial
government to license, regulate, and publicly fund for-profit care homes across
the province. Three changes were crucial to their victory. The first was the
province’s entry into Canada’s new national hospital-insurance scheme in 1959,
which provided Ontarians with insured access to hospital beds on a universal
basis, a major new entitlement that only exacerbated the problem of aging
hospital “bed-blockers.” As Ontario’s Health Minister asked, “When do they
stop being a patient who is chronically ill and in need of … hospital care, and
when do they become a patient who is essentially a … custodial care? ... I cannot
see how these can ever be brought into such a hospital care insurance plan.”
In response, the Ontario Hospital Insurance Commission contracted with
48 private nursing homes to outsource the care of chronic and aged hospital
patients. The more provincial health officials began to learn about private
nursing homes from this new partnership, however, the less they liked them.
“Conditions in the majority of them [are] dreadful,” the health minister warned
Ontario’s premier in 1959 (Struthers, “Reluctant” 178).
    The second change was the previously mentioned extension of federal
funding, under the Unemployment Assistance Act, for the social care of unem-
ployable elderly welfare patients in private nursing homes. This development,
an Ontario government study revealed, created a major stimulus “to the opening
of many … homes with the proprietors, sometimes with no previous experience
and few qualifications, applying for licensing” (Struthers, “Reluctant” 177). The
third was the impact of the Ontario Legislature’s Select Committee on Aging
hearings in 1964–65, which shone a spotlight on atrocious conditions within
private care homes. As the president of the newly formed ANHIO testified,
294   James Struthers


      some operators were making “profits as high as 30 % to 40 % in homes where
      blind patients were served the scrapings off the plates of others.” In others,
      record keeping was so poor that the proprietors “[didn’t] even know how long
      some patients [had] been there.” As for medication, “in most cases there is little
      or no control” (179).
          In Ottawa, witnesses from Ontario’s non-profit care-home sector, testifying
      before the Senate of Canada’s Special Committee on Aging, said that these
      new government subsidies for private nursing homes were only “financing
      public psychological slums” in which people “sit … and rot by the thousands”
      (Struthers, “Reluctant” 180). The impact of this damning testimony created a
      firestorm of negative newspaper coverage that pushed the provincial govern-
      ment into passing the Ontario Nursing Homes Act of 1966, creating a provin-
      cial licensing, inspection, and regulatory regime through the Department of
      Health for all nursing homes in the province. For the largest private operators
      within the ANHIO, this was a key policy victory. Regulation promised to bring
      order to a chaotically expanding sector. It also cemented an uneasy partnership
      between private enterprise and the provincial state to ensure that their prof-
      itability could be reconciled with the government’s fiscal priorities as well as
      with the long-term care needs of the aged.
          Once safely under the umbrella of state licensing and regulation, private care
      home entrepreneurs launched a long-term strategy to place themselves on a level
      playing field with the charitable non-profit and public homes for the aged sector
      by demanding ever higher per diem patient subsidies, to the growing exasper-
      ation of Ontario’s health minister. “[S]ince the province got into the business of
      regulating nursing homes they have constituted themselves a pressure group to
      beat the Government over the head,” he complained to the premier in 1967. Two
      years later he was even more disgusted: “I have learned to my bitter sorrow that
      they are concerned about one thing only, making as much money as possible
      and giving as little as possible in return to the patients … [T]he sooner this is
      gotten into on a public basis, the sooner we will be able to provide good quality
      health care for this segment of our population” (Struthers, “Reluctant” 181).
          The confrontation came to a boil at the end of the 1960s, after a period
      in which the number of private care-home beds leaped from 8,500 to 18,200
      following the passage of the province’s nursing-home legislation. The industry
      was simply growing “without rhyme or reason” as new operators rushed into
      the sector and began building homes “before we know anything about it,”
      Ontario’s deputy health minister complained. Half had been in business less
      than six years, and the health officials charged with overseeing them confessed
      that their own quality of knowledge about the sector was little more than an
      educated guess (Struthers, “Reluctant” 181). In the summer of 1968, private-
      sector care-home owners in Toronto threatened to evict all their subsidized
      welfare patients unless the city agreed to a 47-per-cent increase in the per
                                                   Home, Hotel, Hospital, Hospice     295


diem patient subsidy from the existing $ 8.50 to $ 12.50, as recommended by
a private consulting-firm report commissioned by the ANHIO. City officials,
in response, threatened to move them all to care homes outside the city which
would accept the existing $ 8.50 rate. Outraged residents refused to be moved
away from their families, friends and familiar surroundings and their resis-
tance attracted widespread public and media support. Toronto would be “ill-ad-
vised to consider … shipping the old folks out of town,” a leading newspaper
commented. Repeating a widespread exaggeration, the editors argued, “This
does not seem too far removed from the traditional Eskimo [sic] ceremony of
placing the old and infirm on a small ice-floe and leaving them to drift away”
(qtd. in Struthers, “Reluctant” 183). Eventually a compromise was reached over
a new per diem rate, but the ugliness of the incident was a harbinger of the
difficulties of reconciling caring with profit.
     Over the next four years, demands grew for bringing nursing-home care
into Canada’s new universal Medicare legislation, which Ontario’s Conservative
government only reluctantly joined in 1969. For three years Ontario resisted
the idea, arguing that it would let families off the hook for the care of their own
parents. Why should taxpayers underwrite “by grant or insurance … the main-
tenance of the aged in facilities of some sort, when the families cannot, or will
not, any longer maintain them?,” Ontario’s health minister asked. “Too often, it
is concluded, since an old person has to spend much time in bed and have his
personal wants and needs attended to by others, he should be kept in hospital.
This is wrong.” Here lay the crux of the matter. The need for hospital care
was a medical issue, decided by doctors, so it should be an “insured” benefit.
However, care in nursing homes, deemed mostly “custodial,” seemed to make
it a means-tested welfare benefit, not an insured right. But in practice were the
boundaries that clear-cut? Not according to Ontario’s care-home operators. As
they argued, in a brief to the Senate Committee on Aging, the difference between
“chronically ill care” covered by health insurance and “ordinary chronic care”
within nursing homes was “so indistinguishable as to be hardly discernible by
the experts, let along the uninformed public” (Struthers, “Reluctant” 184).
     By 1972 their view prevailed when, prior to an election, the government
agreed that nursing-home care would be included within the province’s medi-
cal-insurance scheme through a separate Extended Care Plan subsidizing
medical, but not residential costs. With its inclusion under public health insur-
ance, the private nursing-home sector achieved its most important victory.
Under this new umbrella the industry grew by leaps and bounds after 1972,
transforming itself, within five years, from mostly small, single-operator
homes of less than twenty beds into highly profitable 100- to 200-bed facilities,
owned by corporate chains. By 2004, the for-profit sector would be responsible
for 60 per cent of the homes and 54 per cent of the beds in Ontario’s long-term
residential-care sector (Ontario, Commitment 90).
296   James Struthers


      “B uilding a C ulture of C ompliance ”
      From the mid-1970s until the late 1990s, the rapid rate of expansion in Ontar-
      io’s long-term residential-care sector slowed dramatically. Faced with growing
      budgetary deficits and capital shortages as economic conditions worsened
      throughout much of this period, Ontario’s Conservative politicians, who
      governed the province until 1985, were content to let the private sector finance
      the costs of building most new nursing-home beds. During these years, policy
      narratives about long-term care centred on more efficient and intensive care-
      home regulation as well as the impact of increasing longevity, frailty, and popu-
      lation aging on the culture and costs of care homes. Problems with inadequate
      nursing-home inspection, staffing, and management also loomed large, as
      periodic scandals rocked the public’s trust in this sector. In 1977, Daniel Baum’s
      bestselling book Warehouses for Death: The Nursing Home Industry provided a
      bleak portrait of Canadian nursing home life:

      People are there to die. Once they walk through the nursing home door and take their
      rooms, they will not walk out again. They are stripped of their assets, given a small
      personal allowance, promised minimal nursing care, regulated severely in their routine
      and medicated to institutional compliance. In a very real sense they are encapsulated
      and warehoused for death. They are removed from the community and the community
      does not have to see either old age or death. (3)

      This was a far cry from the celebratory descriptions of Ontario’s Homes for
      Aged program in its first two decades. Newspaper exposés added to these
      images. In 1981, the union local representing 300 staff in Greenacres, Ontar-
      io’s largest care home, which, as mentioned previously, was opened in 1956
      specifically to house senile residents from other nearby homes for the aged,
      revealed degrading conditions of work and care for its almost 600 residents.
      Residents were being fed, toileted, and bathed in “factory-like” conditions; staff
      experienced the highest rates of injury of any home in Toronto. Equipment was
      “broken down”; there were such inadequate supplies of clothes, blankets, shoes,
      and socks for residents that “staff had to raid closets at home for shirts for the
      men and dresses for the ladies.” The home was grossly understaffed. Although
      its name “evokes images of a small and tranquil estate in the country,” the
      report concluded, “Greenacres is a large and far from peaceful place. It is not
      a ‘Home.’ It is an institution,” and one that was “in a state of crisis” (CUPE 2,
      6, 8–9). The ensuing media publicity that followed the release of this report
      resulted in a major public enquiry. Three years later, 19 residents in a London,
      Ontario care home died from a serious outbreak of bacterial food poisoning,
      due to substandard conditions for food preparation. This prompted another
      explosion of negative media coverage of Ontario’s long-term residential-care
                                                 Home, Hotel, Hospital, Hospice    297


sector, leading to growing public and political demands for an end to for-profit
ownership. Concerned Friends, a new advocacy organization dedicated to long-
term care reform, described long-term residential-care facilities in 1982 not as
“homes” but as “sterile, friendless [places] … lacking humanness and warmth,
where old people sit and rock, stare at walls for most of their day or are led
around by the hand like small children.” In 1984, a Canadian Medical Associa-
tion Task Force argued that care homes should be “run on a principle of loving
care, not tender loving greed,” and recommended that governments “move as
quickly as possible towards the elimination of care for-profit institutions and
establish non-profit facilities” (Tarman 76–83).
    The Ontario government response was more bureaucratic consolidation
and intensive regulation of the sector. Rather than address issues of who owned
care homes, the province instead focused on more aggressively enforcing a
culture of “compliance.” Annual inspections of care homes were mandated,
and the reports were made public. Resident councils were promoted. A Resi-
dents’ Bill of Rights was introduced, which included “freedom from mental
and physical abuse” and “privacy.” Complaint-reporting mechanisms were
expanded and made more transparent. Nursing-home owners were required
to identify their directors and owners and to release their financial statements
so that the public could see how much revenue was spent on residents rather
than in dividends for shareholders. A new category of “compliance officers”
was created to advise care homes on how best to meet new and more intrusive
Ministry of Health standards. But the question of private ownership of care
homes itself was left unaddressed by both Conservative and Liberal govern-
ments of that decade (Tarman 82–88).
    Instead, in response to a court challenge and more aggressive lobbying
from the private care-home sector, in 1993 per diem government funding for
privately owned, charitable non-profit, and public care homes was made iden-
tical by Ontario’s left of centre New Democratic Party government, the unex-
pected winners of the 1990 provincial election. Since all homes now had to
meet the same, more highly medicalized requirements, their level of per-patient
government funding should also be equal, the NDP acknowledged. At the same
time, the government also transferred all responsibility for care homes to the
Ministry of Health, marking an end to separate oversight of municipal Homes
for the Aged and non-profit charitable homes by the Ministry of Community
and Social Services. This was another major victory for the for-profit sector,
(Tarman, 87, Daly, 44)
    Care-home policy narratives from the early 1990s to the present have
increasingly focused on fears around the costs of population aging as the baby-
boom generation matures into old age. A major 2012 Ontario government
report on aging makes no mention of private care-home ownership whatsoever,
but instead it frankly warns that “our demographic challenge could bankrupt
298   James Struthers


      the province,” in arguing for a moratorium on building new care homes. A new
      “Seniors Strategy” should “focus on helping older Ontarians to stay healthy and
      stay at home longer” through concentrating on homecare as the most fiscally
      responsible solution to population aging (Ontario, Living 5–6). Another report,
      from 2011, argues that Ontario is still relying “too heavily on acute care hospital
      resources and a culture that emphasizes ‘permanent’ placement of seniors
      in Long-Term Care Homes without appropriate consideration of the patient’s
      potential to improve or recover and be cared for at home with support.” As in
      the 1940s, aging “bed-blockers” clogging up provincial hospitals are seen as
      the most urgent problem facing long-term care (Ontario, Caring for Our Aging
      6–7).
          An intensified focus on implementing an “audit” culture in nursing-home
      management has also emerged, in which “hard” quantifiable measurements
      such as pressure ulcers, blood-sugar levels, incidence of falls, fluid intake, and
      incontinence are viewed as the key inputs for measuring the “quality of life”
      in Ontario care homes and for determining their level of funding. Reduced
      emphasis is placed on the “softer” and less quantifiable variables of relational
      and social care performed by staff, whose numbers, since 1996, are no longer
      regulated by any minimum standard (Banerjee and Armstrong, Daly). The
      extent to which care homes should be allowed discretion to imagine different
      approaches for delivering good quality care in a “home-like” atmosphere
      remains subject to debate. While one report argues for “tougher enforcement
      and swift compliance” as well as “clear, measurable, enforceable, resident-fo-
      cused standards with enforceability … being key” (Ontario, Commitment 5),
      another decries the impact of such a “compliance culture” on the ability of
      these facilities to be “homes”:

      Many stakeholders told us that often this results in situations where staff focus on
      compliance-related administrative and process activities instead of on providing care.
      In addition, they indicated that time dedicated to resident care is diverted to compli-
      ance-related functions, many of which are related to documentation and other paper
      work. (Ontario, People 11)

      The first narrative has care homes facing outwards to concentrate on provincial
      standards. The second looks inwards in arguing for more locally based decision
      making “building on the knowledge, passion, and commitment of staff, LTC
      home operators, residents, and families to the provision of quality care. They
      set the stage for a change in how LTC homes plan to use their staff resources to
      meet resident needs” (Ontario, People 29; Banerjee and Armstrong).

C onclusion
From 1949 to 1972, the Ontario government believed it had a coherent story to tell
about care homes for the aged during the only era in which long-term residential
care was portrayed in a mostly positive light. It was an uplifting and gendered narra-
tive about the virtues of social care in delivering comfort, dignity, and “successful”
aging within a communal context that officials insisted was “homelike” and “luxu-
rious.” This was also a story about Ontario’s postwar affluence, the earned entitle-
ment of its “senior citizens,” and burgeoning municipal and provincial pride.
    To make this “homelike” story work, however, the numbers of vulnerable
older adults who were senile, bed-ridden, or in other ways profoundly “helpless”
had to be kept to a minimum through being segregated either within or between
institutions. It was also a story about care homes as legitimate sites for an enjoy-
able and non-stigmatized middle-class life pursued by “active” individuals getting
along together within a “quiet and intimate” setting, with some paid female care
help from the state (Williams; Davies, Into the House). The trade-off, within the
setting of new postwar suburbs, was an architecture facing mostly inwards as a
“haven” looking away from the “busy” community outside, echoing in a smaller
way the broader postwar suburban “home dreams” also being pursued by the
children of the care homes’ new residents (Davies, Into the House; Strong-Boag).
    In contrast and in tension with this positive story was the rise of Ontario’s
nursing-home industry during the same era, which was a more incoherent,
unexpected, contested, and increasingly medicalized development. This was
a narrative of unintended consequences, grudging regulation and inspec-
tion, and recurring scandal. And the end result was anything but “homelike.”
Within these buildings, the type and quality of care remained in service to
the overarching needs of Ontario hospitals to free up scarce beds, and to the
dividends of a mostly profit-seeking industry. At bottom, this was also largely a
story of “facilities,” not “homes.”
    By the 1990s, these two parallel stories of homes for the aged and nursing
homes had converged, symbolized by the takeover of the entire field by Ontar-
io’s Ministry of Health (Daly, 44–47). It has increasingly become a narrative
dominated by the themes of medical more than social care, in which relent-
lessly rising costs, overcrowded hospitals, and rising panic over population
aging continue to be the dominant actors. Once existing on the margins, a
new emphasis on “community” care has also been in steady ascent since the
1990s and now dominates state-centred conversations about “home” and “care”
within the province’s policy discourse on how best to meet the needs of Ontar-
io’s vulnerable older adults. A century after worried provincial officials first
shone a spotlight on the growing “burdens” of old age within Ontario’s Houses
of Refuge, family care and family obligations are once again back at the centre
of a new government story called “Bringing Care Home” (Ontario, Bringing).
